Hi, I am Geshan. I am a software engineer, with more than a decade of software engineering experience. Currently, I am living in Sydney, Australia serving THE ICONIC as a lead software engineer. 

<img class="center" src="/images/generic/loading.gif" data-echo="/images/geshan.jpg" title="Geshan Manandhar" alt="Geshan Manandhar">

I have a keen interest in REST architecture, microservices and cloud computing. I am a language-agnostic software engineer who believes the value provided to the business is more important than the choice of language or framework.

## Consciously evolving

I was born and lived the majority of my life in Kathmandu, Nepal. I have lived and worked in the Netherlands, U.A.E and Australia. This multi-cultural experience has enriched my life in various aspects. It has also given me chances to work on software systems of varying scale that millions of customers have used, benefitted from and can rely upon.

## Day to day

Day to day, I use mainly Javascript (Node.js) and PHP with MySQL database to translate business requirements into reliable, scalable, and reslilient software.

## Why This blog?

I have been blogging since 2007, I blog about things I have learnt, things I want to share or just something I want to rant about :). The best feeling is, when you are stuck on something you Google for a solution and you end up finding your own blog post written some years back. That feeling is priceless.

Another factor that motivates me to keep on publishing blog posts is the feedback you get from people. I have been told that the person was looking for something technical and one of my blog posts. The person added, it helped to solve the issue or learn something new. This also gives me a sense of immense satisfaction.

## Public Speaking

I have given [talks](/blog/categories/talks/) at tech conferences in the Middle East, Europe, United States and Australia in the past years from topics ranging from ChatOps, Continous delivery to Microservices and Serverless containers. You can see a neatly organized [table](https://github.com/geshan/public-speaking) as a github repo. I have also spoken at various meetups.

## Side Projects

I have a couple of side projects. I only do one side project a year to get it over the line :):

### Nepal News English - 2019

[Nepal News English](https://twitter.com/nepal_news_en) twitter account, is a news aggreagtor that aggregates News about Nepal from 15+ sources. It was re-built in 2019 with Node.js and MySQL. All the code is running on Google Cloud Run. Please follow Nepal_news_en if you want to get all the news about Nepal in English language at one place. It currently has 12.4 K followers.

### AU Tech Jobs - 2020

[AU Tech Jobs](https://autechjobs.ml/) is a tech job aggreagator which collects jobs from 50+ companies. Currently the [app](https://app.autechjobs.ml/) has over 1400 jobs listed. It's USPs include:

* Job descrition summary for easy reading
* Tag job as non technical by using external categorization service
* Saved jobs
* Applied jobs
* Shows if company is known to sponsor work visa or not

This side project has been a joint effort of more than two dozen people. I thank each and everyonne of them for their time and support. This project was seeded from [Australian companies providing work visa sponsorship](https://github.com/geshan/au-companies-providing-work-visa-sponsorship) github repo I started in 2018.
