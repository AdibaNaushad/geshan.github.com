Hi, I am Geshan. I am a software engineer, with more than a decade of software engineering experience. Currently, I am living in Sydney, Australia serving THE ICONIC as a senior software engineer. Thanks for coming to my blog, hope you have found the post(s) useful.

I have a keen interest in REST architecture, microservices and cloud computing. I am a language agnostic software engineer who believes the value provided to the business is more important than the choice of language or framework.
