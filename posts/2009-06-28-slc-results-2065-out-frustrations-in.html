Just back from my work place I heard a news on FM,  "SLC result 2065" is out and record high 68% passed this year. At the back of my mind a thought struck "Oh! my cousin sister also gave SLC this year". The news continued the results can be viewed online at <a href="http://www.moe.gov.np/" target="_blank">www.soec.gov.np</a>, <a href="http://www.moe.gov.np/" target="_blank">www.moe.gov.np</a> and <a href="http://www.doe.gov.np/" target="_blank">www.doe.gov.np</a>.<br /><br />I rushed to my room and connected to the internet, to my surprise and utter dismay SOEC.com.np said "SLC result 2065 has not been published yet!" but still I punched in her symbol no. and the result was nothing. It was so slow I had to open the website in Chrome, trying over the same thing again and again I found out there was an unexplainable error. It was simple overload and I got a not found error in result.php. And yes MOE and DOE do not have SLC results or even the word SLC 2065 on their home pages.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Skdx_b2IuTI/AAAAAAAABCU/MMxT0Icgv7Y/s1600-h/soec.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 276px;" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Skdx_b2IuTI/AAAAAAAABCU/MMxT0Icgv7Y/s400/soec.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352372016773642546" border="0" /></a>Then after some minutes I got the following screen, oh my luck:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SkdyXOuuBPI/AAAAAAAABCc/1-HPICyp-0c/s1600-h/soec_suspended.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 276px;" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SkdyXOuuBPI/AAAAAAAABCc/1-HPICyp-0c/s400/soec_suspended.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352372425569731826" border="0" /></a>The site was suspended by the provided may be due to overload. So I sent a SMS to 7373 but here also no luck there was no sign of getting the result. Then I searched some news sites, then I found a news on The Himalayan Times website below:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Skdzlu7G5AI/AAAAAAAABCk/Z0wehamg0gQ/s1600-h/tht_news.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 276px;" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Skdzlu7G5AI/AAAAAAAABCk/Z0wehamg0gQ/s400/tht_news.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352373774241424386" border="0" /></a>But again they did not check the sites and wrote "The results can also be viewed by logging on to the websites: " I guess they forgot to write "After some hours" in that line. Another news told you can listen to the result Dialing 1600 on a land line and it said the result in not yet published. Man I had not tried this hard to know my own SLC result, I was lazying on my bed as at our times it was published in the morning 5 AM ;). Now already frustrated I checked twitter, after Michael Jackson people were tweeting about it but no one new an answer how to get the results.<br /><br /><h4>My Frustration</h4><ol><li>Why "shout out loud" in media before the result is published.</li><li>Why don't people in media FM, online media check things before telling them out</li><li>Why is there no concept of load balancing on these sort of high traffic and high priority things. <a href="http://twitter.com/bibstha" target="_blank">@bibstha</a> man it must be done, lets do it.<br /></li><li>There were 3 alternative sites none had a thing <a href="http://slc.ntc.net.np/" target="_blank">www.slc.ntc.net.np</a> said " SLC 2065 Result will be available here as soon as it is published officially- Thank you".</li><li>The SMS thing and dialing 1600 was on no use.<br /></li></ol><h4>Some Suggestions</h4><ol><li>Don't publicize things that you have not tried.</li><li>Don't publish results in the evening ;)</li><li>In result publishing make it a single/multiple text or HTML file where one can search easily not a database request just because in our system it times out.</li><li>Let the results of SLC be available via multiple servers or great load balancing 3 lakh 91 thousand is a very big number if around 30 % view results online its more than 1 lakh 17 thousand.</li><li>Use technology so that people have faith on it, not one that does not work when needed and people hate it.</li></ol>And Yes if you need the result get the raw txt in zipped format at : <a href="https://files.getdropbox.com/u/547169/slc2065result.zip" target="_blank">https://files.getdropbox.com/u/547169/slc2065result.zip</a> thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jwalanta" target="_blank">@jwalanta</a> and also at <a href="http://ioelive.com/slc2065" target="_blank">http://ioelive.com/slc2065</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>I don't know why I wrote this as this is a sheer waste of time, nothings going to change. But if someone reads this and can bring in even a small change I would be happy.<br /></blockquote></div>
