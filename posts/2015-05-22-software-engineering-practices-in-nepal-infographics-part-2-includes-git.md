I hope life is slowly going back to normal in Nepal though the news of aftershocks is not encouraging. My prayers are with the
people of Nepal and I hope they get the positive energy to resume with their normal work.

Below is the Part 2 of the Software Engineering Practices in Nepal Infographics. This time the graphical information covers
popularity of Versioin Control System (VCS), VCS hosting, Operating System (OS), Coding Standard, Code Reviews and other 
interesting facts from the survey. 

Again special thanks to [Ashish Singh](http://bit.ly/ashish-singh-blog) for helping 
me clean up and compile the data in a better way. And this time even [Ansubha Manandhar](http://bit.ly/ansu-blog) rolled up
her sleeves and helped us group and compile the data into percentages, thank you for that.

**Data for this infographics is taken from this [survey](http://bit.ly/nep-dev-survey), I kindly request you to fill it.**
