<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Last week when I was in Kathmandu, Nepal I did a talk at Prime College, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PrimeCollegeEdu" target="_blank">college</a> where I did my bachelor (undergraduate) and my Plus 2. The talk was about "Things I wished I knew while doing my bachelor / undergraduate".<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtKoXBoap4Q/VAHJsvUvyJI/AAAAAAAA1VY/i_yQa3M_AxI/s1600/IMG_6212.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtKoXBoap4Q/VAHJsvUvyJI/AAAAAAAA1VY/i_yQa3M_AxI/s1600/IMG_6212.JPG" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br />This talk was about how to use your bachelor to craft your tech career. I started with what I have done and some examples of where my friends have reached. Then I focused on things to consider for selecting and doing projects for technical subjects in bachelor study.<!-- more --><br /><br />After that I opened up the secrets of selecting a company and doing internship. To concluded I gave some tips on approaching the job market. I think the talk went good and I was able to convey my message correctly to all the participants. I hope the students will benefit from it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ANWhlgkDt30/VAHMMEwkPII/AAAAAAAA1Vs/OootCd-ErEc/s1600/IMG_6214.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ANWhlgkDt30/VAHMMEwkPII/AAAAAAAA1Vs/OootCd-ErEc/s1600/IMG_6214.JPG" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Attentive Students</h3><div>Thankfully the bachelor students who attended the talk were very attentive and inquisitive towards what I was presenting. I was expecting more students from Bachelor of Information Management (BIM) but the majority were from Bsc. CSIT 6<sup>th</sup> semester. I am happy and thankful to the attendees who gave their time to listening to what I had to say.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OteueCLjnOg/VAHKxTz6s_I/AAAAAAAA1Vg/hDbklcsNONE/s1600/IMG_6211.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OteueCLjnOg/VAHKxTz6s_I/AAAAAAAA1Vg/hDbklcsNONE/s1600/IMG_6211.JPG" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><h3 style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The Slides</h3>Below are the slides of the talk:<br /><script async="" class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="a612f9300f4b01323f425661ce134671" data-ratio="1.37265415549598" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">And the video</h3></div><div>The video of the talk is here, it has the full presentation and some questions:</div><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bipt8697_PI?rel=0" width="640"></iframe><br /></center><h3 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h3><div>Overall the weeks long preparation of the slides came out very fruitful.
