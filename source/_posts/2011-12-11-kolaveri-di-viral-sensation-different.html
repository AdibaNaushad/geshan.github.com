<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Kolaveri Di is a song from a tamil flick named "3", it released on 16-November-2011 and became viral in social media mainly the videos on Youtube. Without doubts, it is a sensation that has more than 1.1 million views/listens on youtube in less than 3 weeks. Kolaveri Di means “why do you have this murderous rage against me?” &nbsp;as per the composer Anirudh Ravichander who is doing his debut.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uiubEgi1RBM/TuSXL6tTNRI/AAAAAAAAM0I/wTJbxph3R9k/s1600/kolaveri_di.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uiubEgi1RBM/TuSXL6tTNRI/AAAAAAAAM0I/wTJbxph3R9k/s400/kolaveri_di.png" height="303" width="400" /></a></div><br />The song is an easygoing, bindass, baal chhaina kind song. It has the feel good factor about it but when you listen to it for the first time it seems bad. Similar to Shehar from Rockstar at first you think the song is not good but it takes over you after some listening. The lyrics are mad but the tune is catchy. But this post is not just about Kolaveri, it is about the different version you will find below after the original version:<br /><br /><br /></div><h3>    Kolaveri Di Original Version</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jM9s_A4PL5o?rel=0" width="480"></iframe> <br /><h3>    Female Version</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="274" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yUa6JR0jw1I?rel=0" width="480"></iframe> <br /><h3>    Give me Milk Version by Naveen Nigam</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="244" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nLJYkat4HpE?rel=0" width="480"></iframe> <br /><h3>    One Random Remix</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dnve1kXZesA?rel=0" width="480"></iframe> <br /><h2>Bonus</h2><h3>R n B Flavored English Version</h3><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="244" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/q2a80UygeU8" width="480"></iframe>  <br /><br /><blockquote>I hope you like it and yes Kolaveri Di</blockquote></div></div>
