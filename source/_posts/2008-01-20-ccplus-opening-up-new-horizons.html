It aims to provide more permission beyond any standard CC License. Lets demystify the jargon, CCPlus (not C++ ) has a basic idea to use a CC license appended with another agreement that provided “more permission”. For some people it would be like gazing at a newspaper advert which consists of that * (conditions apply) after the very catchy line.<br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/R5Mx84aKKKI/AAAAAAAAANA/Sd8ThfvWNJM/s1600-h/ccp_license.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/R5Mx84aKKKI/AAAAAAAAANA/Sd8ThfvWNJM/s320/ccp_license.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5157520920273365154" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center;" /></a><br /><br />The official Creative Commons website’s (<a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">www.creativecommons.org</a>) wiki has a note that reads “NOTE: Above, the CC license should link to the human deed and the generic commercial license would link to a place to get a commercial license for a work. The COMMERCIAL LICENSE is generic and should be tailored for specific uses with specific names of copyright holders.” So something immature I make out of this is that you are giving more permission to make the intellectual property commercially viable but keeping the creative commons license as the base license. I hope I am right.<br /><br />The official site’s summary does try to clarify thing, in addition it exclaims “CC+ architecture gives businesses a simple way to move between the sharing and commercial economies.” I think that’s a very good approach to looking at things. It further says it helps to solve legal, human and technical problems but how I didn’t get the idea clear even after going through the provided PDFs. A thing I could get is that the new approach will allow the people who want more permission to get it from a contact which is mainly a URL.<br /><br />So this is show it is said that it will work, I write a book or compose a song or make a video I put the desired CC license to it but in addition I also provide a URL that says Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at (ur URL). An important thing is “If you want to adopt CC+, please (1) implement CC+ simple technology on your site, (2) add your project/company name, and (3) <a href="http://creativecommons.org/contact">let us know!</a>” , so this will enable CC to enlist your project/company name and the good (mainly digital) and notify user of the accompanying commercial license illustrated in the company site itself. Simply it’s a personalized license on top of the standard CC license.<br /><br />Some <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus#Adopters">adopters</a> and <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus#Mockups">mockups</a> are mentioned in the wiki page. The use cases on the page seem to justify the need and use of CC+ and it as good way to add a custom commercial license to your CC attributed work.<br /><br />Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 450 Words<br /><br /><br /></div></div></div>
