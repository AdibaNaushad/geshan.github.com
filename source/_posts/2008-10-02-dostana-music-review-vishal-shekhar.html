After the not so successful Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna (KANK), Dostana is the latest offering by Dharma Productions, the Dostana of 1980 featured Big B and a different story line but this Dostana of 2008 has its own twists and turns. The promos look scintillating with curvy Priyanka,<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SOTeD6RD_0I/AAAAAAAAAm8/C0T-GwvVx88/s1600-h/Front_Cover_Small.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SOTeD6RD_0I/AAAAAAAAAm8/C0T-GwvVx88/s320/Front_Cover_Small.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5252567224182636354" border="0" /></a> muscular John and stylish Abhishek. Shot in the US the movie seems to have a different story line. The cover has a mild feel to it with simple white and off colors with the three actors in it. It is simple but effective. Let’s introspect what the songs in this compilation have in store. Vishal and Shekhar in this album have put six songs with no remixes different from what they are doing.<br /><br />“Janey Kyon” I assume can be tagged the anthem track of this album which has a cool groove to it from the word go. Featuring hinglish lyric by Anvita Dutt Guptan it is a song that gets stuck to you head due to the simple composition, catchy arrangement and youthful lyric about friendship. Sung by Vishal, it’s hard to believe it’s his vocals, the duo has done lots of synthesizing in this track for sure which sound artificial at times. The beginning of “Desi Girl” marks the start of a can be item dance number. Effortlessly vocalized by Shankar Mahadevan and Sunidhi Chauhan, this is a fast paced track with India arrangement at start and composition to break a leg. The song’s music takes some retro and synthetic shades in the mid but get back to the conventional instruments. Lyric written by Kumaar depicts he beauty of a desi girl in comparison to “others”. Next “Maa Da Laadla” follows, with a strange starting this track surprises with the vocals of Saleem of the Saleem Sulaiman duo. Lyrics penned by Kumaar again he leaves no stone unturned to criticize marriage. The party feel still continues and the signature Vishal Shekhar speaks louder in this track.<br /><br />A number that will keep you on your toes is “Shut Up &amp; Bounce”, this is a typical Vishal Shekhar dance track with all the elements to be a party starter. Crooned in a brilliant fashion by talented Sunidhi and well supported by bouncy Vishal this song has the percussion to keep you up all night. Written by Anvita this song is set to be the next disco anthem. After some groovy and disco friendly tracks a light lullaby number “Khabar Nahi” is different from the rest. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SOTefJJOH4I/AAAAAAAAAnE/RyfA1jLkFVE/s1600-h/Back_cover_Small.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SOTefJJOH4I/AAAAAAAAAnE/RyfA1jLkFVE/s320/Back_cover_Small.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5252567692032745346" border="0" /></a>Effervescent lyric about love Anvita proves her writing skills with two totally different songs. Simple composition and use of acoustic sounds makes this song very easy on the ears but retains a catchy groove. It keeps you up to that extra mile “It’s got to be love coz it’s really got me going” part is really pleasant. Last track is “Kuch Kam” sung by the silk voiced Shaan in a splendid manner. Unbelievable but true over-active Vishal penned such subtle lyrics and the composition compliments the light love favoring lyric. The arrangement is also very minimal yet likable from the first listen.<br /><br />All in all, Vishal Shekhar prove their mettle in this album with no remixes but the collection of four fast paced tracks and two slow light tracks to end with is first-rate. The singer selection is also very good with the new lyricists the duo has given a different taste in this album. If you liked previous albums by Vishal Shekhar don’t forget to buy this one.<br /><br />Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 600 Words<br /><br />Hope the movie will be good, for now just have a look at the promo of “Janey Kyon”.<br /><br /><object height="324" width="400"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Yfxi4uDbqTE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Yfxi4uDbqTE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" height="324" width="400"></embed></object></div>
