Every company is a [technology company](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/01/23/why-every-company-is-a-technology-company/#62d4503657ae). A technology company without great software and technical team is insignificant. In this post I will unfold my understanding of what makes a tech team competent in 4 levels with 6 main criteria and 25 sub criteria.

## Assumptions

Below are some of the assumptions I have made for this opinionated matrix:

* It focuses on a tech/engineering team doing software development.
* It tilts towards software teams practicing agile methodologies.
* It is more targeted towards web applications/APIs developing teams.
* Many things can be added to the 6 main criteria and 25 sub criteria, still these 25 points I think are important.
* Many things are dependent on the scale your team works at, for example if you get 2 requests per minute you don't need a load-balancer :)



## The matrix

If its difficult to read jump directly to the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDx5RG8k7Oxl6REGPgZIG-qqCNfn3E8WwczPPyoWvSA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Add more things

If you want to add more things check this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDx5RG8k7Oxl6REGPgZIG-qqCNfn3E8WwczPPyoWvSA/edit?usp=sharing) and comment below.

Thanks the the people who helped me review this and for their valuable inputs. And thanks Sijin Joseph for the [programmer competency matrix](http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/) from where I got the idea to
make such kind a matrix on a team level then individual programmer.

## Conclusion

As a company evaluates any programmer, you could try to rate your team or processes giving them a point as per the level in each of the 25 criteria.
So any team could score between 25-100 (25 is level 1 on each point and 100 is level 4 in each point). It should be an interesting exercise, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nenLo3uV3xN0PBt-heg0HLogLgHKw32QFeF4wj6Hdqs/edit?usp=sharing) is an example.

> Hopefully you know where your tech competency/maturity stands on a team level better now.
