Before you sign up to a web host and get locked in spending your hard earned cash, do consider evaluating all the options available and read what others have to say about the web host you are choosing. In this regard, web hosting review websites help you make your life easier and your decision better.<br /><br />In search of good <a href="http://webhostinggeeks.com/">web hosting reviews</a> websites I found, <a href="http://webhostinggeeks.com/">www.webhostinggeeks.com</a>. This website has top 10 web hosts listed in its homepage, with summary of the web host's features and bonus features highlighted in the table it makes it easier for a potential customer to know what the site offers.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Saa7dnUcNkI/AAAAAAAAA-A/BPxBwDDN6Oc/s1600-h/whg_home_page.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 242px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Saa7dnUcNkI/AAAAAAAAA-A/BPxBwDDN6Oc/s400/whg_home_page.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5307135328348026434" border="0" /></a>The homepage has a good information section about web hosting toward the bottom of the page describing simple things as what is web hosting to how to choose a web host. These things are very helpful to people who want to know how to evaluate a web host for their needs and how much they should pay for the services.<br /><br />The Webhosting awards, section awards hosts for best blog hosting, best PHP hosting, best VPS hosting etc. Here I guess they want to promote the best in the business as per the reviews they have received in the past year.<br /><br />Hosting review looks very well organized with ratings for major factors we look in a web host like up time &amp; stability, technical support, customer support to name some. I can post a review of the web host without even signing up and can rate the host in 9 factors in a scale of 1 to 5.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Saa9Vp6H4RI/AAAAAAAAA-I/Mo0qlpMoD70/s1600-h/whg_review.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 224px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Saa9Vp6H4RI/AAAAAAAAA-I/Mo0qlpMoD70/s400/whg_review.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5307137390627250450" border="0" /></a><br /><blockquote>All in all, if you want a new web host or want to change your existing web host search for good options at <a href="http://webhostinggeeks.com/">www.webhostinggeeks.com</a> which provides in depth and honest reviews of web hosts.</blockquote></div>
