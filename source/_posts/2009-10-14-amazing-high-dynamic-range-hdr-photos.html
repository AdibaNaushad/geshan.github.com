<a href="http://www.yipl.com.np/" target="_blank">YoungInnovaitons Private Limited</a> is a company consisting of talented people. Among them <a href="http://pras.net.np" target="_blank">Prashant Shrestha</a> our own XHTML/CSS guru can work his hands greatly on the camera mainly the single lens reflex (SLR). He recently tried his hands on High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography. See below and image that depicts the beauty of HDR.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2553/3833836500_317f243a5a.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="285" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2553/3833836500_317f243a5a.jpg" width="420" /></a><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><br /><p>Wikipedia defines HDR as "In image processing, computer graphics, and photography, high dynamic range imaging (HDRI or just HDR) is a set of techniques that allow a greater dynamic range of luminances between the lightest and darkest areas of an image than standard digital imaging techniques or photographic methods. This wider dynamic range allows HDR images to represent more accurately the wide range of intensity levels found in real scenes ranging from direct sunlight to faint starlight." And the images below gives you the feel what its all about.<br /></p><br /><br /><div id="PictoBrowser091014195702">Get the flash player here: http://www.adobe.com/flashplayer</div><script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.db798.com/pictobrowser/swfobject.js"></script><script type="text/javascript"> var so = new SWFObject("http://www.db798.com/pictobrowser.swf", "PictoBrowser", "500", "500", "8", "#EEEEEE"); so.addVariable("source", "sets"); so.addVariable("names", "HDR"); so.addVariable("userName", "prashant_sh"); so.addVariable("userId", "13978609@N08"); so.addVariable("ids", "72157622074470620"); so.addVariable("titles", "on"); so.addVariable("displayNotes", "on"); so.addVariable("thumbAutoHide", "off"); so.addVariable("imageSize", "medium"); so.addVariable("vAlign", "mid"); so.addVariable("vertOffset", "0"); so.addVariable("colorHexVar", "EEEEEE"); so.addVariable("initialScale", "off"); so.addVariable("bgAlpha", "90"); so.write("PictoBrowser091014195702"); </script><br /><br /><blockquote>Hope you like the pictures taken by the man himself - Prashant Shrestha. check out his flickr page at <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/prashant_sh" target="_blank">http://flickr.com/photos/prashant_sh</a>. </blockquote></div>
