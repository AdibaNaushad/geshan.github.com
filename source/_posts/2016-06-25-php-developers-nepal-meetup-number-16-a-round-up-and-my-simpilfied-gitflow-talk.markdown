I had given a talk in the PHP Developers Nepal meetup #14 in Aug 2014 about [Rabbit Mq and Symfony](http://geshan.com.np/blog/2014/08/basic-overview-of-message-queues-rabbit/).
This time the [meetup](http://developers-nepal.github.io/php/meetups/25-Jun-2016/) took place at
Prime College on 25-June-2016. There were 2 half hour talks for this meetup and one 5 minute lightening
talk about the community. For this 16th installment, we were doing an open discussion for the first time.
The topic of open discussion was "Does automated deployment and DevOps add value to the organization?".
It was the highlight of the event.

## How did it unfold

The first talk was given by Amrit GC on "Ansible for PHP Developers", then I presented my talk on "Simplified Gitflow".
After those two regular talks we had a lightening talk presented by Manish Jung Thapan (MJT) on PHP Developers Nepal Community.
Last part of the program was an open discussion on "Does automated deployment and DevOps add value to the organization?" which
got a lot of questions from the audience. It was great to moderate the open discussion. Overall it was an amazing meetup. I guess
there were around 100 participants which makes it one of the biggest PHP Developers meetup in terms of audience size.

## My Talk on Simplified Gitflow

This is not the first time I was presenting this talk :). I had already given this talk at [YIPL in Mar 2015](http://geshan.com.np/blog/2015/09/how-to-use-simplified-gitflow-branching-model-video/).
Now 15 months later I was doing it again. This time I changed the slides and made it more general.
I hope it was helpful to the audience.

## Hope to see more meetups

Hope there will be a Developers Nepal meetup which is lanauge agnostic soon. Kudos.
