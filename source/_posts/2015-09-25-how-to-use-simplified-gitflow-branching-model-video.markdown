Just knowing git and all team members pushing code to the main branch (master) is not a good practice.
To leverage the most out of git it is a good idea to do feature branching and follow a branching model.
GitFlow is one of the options for doing a feature branching model but it is not so straight forward,
In this blog post with a video and presenation I would elaborage on how a team can use `simplified gitflow`
and get the most out of using git.

I talk about git flow for the first 15-16 minutes then I start answering quesitons on git and gitflow. Then
I explain about other things in git which can be helpful. I did this presenation at [YIPL](http://yipl.com.np)
on 11-Mar-2015. I know its a late post its like a part 2 of [Do you git your code? Follow this simplified gitflow branching model to improve productivity](http://bit.ly/s-git-flow).

> Hope you learn something new about git and simplified gitflow from this video.
