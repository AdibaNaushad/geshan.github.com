description: Frontend is HTML+CSS and Javascript, backend has one backend language and database. Full stack is both, then what is Super stack development? Read more here.

I looked at archive.org and found a website I put live in 2001, which means I have been writing some code for 20 years. Of course, I am not going to give a link to that website still it will be safe to mention 20 years back in Kathmandu when people didn’t have an email I had built websites. I uploaded it over a 33.8k modem with a dial-up connection. Kids these days will not even know the sound of that modem (yes I am old).

Coming back to the topic, this is an “oversimplified” guide to showing the difference between backend, frontend, full-stack, and (in my own terms) super stack development of course, with a web development focus. Let’s get started

## Introduction 

Software engineering is a hot topic these days and hearing random people like a [minister](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/476391-biden-tells-coal-miners-to-learn-to-code) urging people to learn to code is amusing at times. They make it look as if learning to code is easy and getting a high paid job after you know how to code is a piece of cake. Simple common sense, it is not. Anyways, the most common things software engineers build are websites and web applications. This post highlight the paths you can take in the web development aspect of software engineering.

## Oversimplification

Yes, there is going to be a lot of oversimplification for this blog post. If I go into a lot of detail it will confuse many people and I want this piece to be beginner-friendly. So to start with below is my understanding of backend, frontend, full-stack, and super stack development:

From the above image, it is pretty clear, blue thing (light and dark both) are frontend, green (+ some yellow the DB) is backend stuff. Orange is representing full stack and the bottom yellow line indicates super stack development. Let’s go into more details for each of them below:

## All ends and non ends

It is clear that this is a comparison between ends and non-ends, backEND, frontEnd, full-stack, and super stack. A quick distinction is what you see rendered on the web browser is usually frontend, the languages that talks to the datastore are mostly backend. If the software work consists of both backend and frontend it can be termed full-stack. So what is the super stack work, read on... 

> I will write only points for each of the web development work categories and keep it high level.

### Backend development

Some of my observatioin about backend development

* Development work will involve working with at least one backend language like PHP, NodeJs, Ruby, Python, Java, etc which can communicate with a database/datastore. 
* Backend software development work will encompass designing of Relational databases which is generally represented as [Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams)
* Backend work will require the software engineer/developer to understand more complex concepts of the database like concurrency, [locking](https://www.methodsandtools.com/archive/archive.php?id=83) and [transactions](https://vladmihalcea.com/a-beginners-guide-to-acid-and-database-transactions/).
* Of course, to do backend knowledge of [SQL](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql) will be indispensable
* To do backend development work well knowledge of network, DNS, APIs,
