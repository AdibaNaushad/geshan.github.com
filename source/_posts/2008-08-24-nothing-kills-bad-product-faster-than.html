Windows Vista is the latest offered operating system by Microsoft, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7" target="_blank">Windows 7</a> is in the making and Windows XP is also still popular but may be due to exorbitant hardware demands and very low software compatibility vista is not popular. Popular let's say its not even accepted till now so ZDNET informs <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=499" target="_blank">here</a> Microsoft is spending a whopping #300 Million to promote Vista. A teaser is given below:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SLFCfbsyudI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/p5T1m0HXaV8/s1600-h/windows_earth_flat_ad.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SLFCfbsyudI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/p5T1m0HXaV8/s400/windows_earth_flat_ad.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5238040949387606482" border="0" /></a><br />An old advert here from youtube says Vista is more secure, more.....<br /><br /><object width="400" height="330"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2g-SFpzJshs&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6&amp;border=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2g-SFpzJshs&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="400" height="330"></embed></object><br /><br /><blockquote>Now with the user access control giving problems on every application load and with lots of stability issues this $ 300 million ad. campaign will be a nightmare for Vista I guess. Let's hope that Windows 7 is better and will come soon in the market for the upgrade. For now nothing will kill Vista faster than the $300 Million Ad. Campaign. Best of luck vista ;-).</blockquote></div>
