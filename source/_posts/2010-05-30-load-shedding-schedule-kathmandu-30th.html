After months and months of waiting and some precious rain the load shedding has been slashed to half of what it was. Now the load shedding has been decreased to 6 hours per day from 12 hours a day some months ago.<br /><br />This must have given relief to all of us but the football world cup 2010 fans may have been disappointed as when the matches air they might not be able to watch their favourite team play. Anyway below is the load shedding schedule of Kathmandu as of 30th May 2010:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/TAb9yAoukzI/AAAAAAAABW8/Q_vdtyxn_h4/s1600/Load_Shedding_Schedule_Ktm_30May2010.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="257" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/TAb9yAoukzI/AAAAAAAABW8/Q_vdtyxn_h4/s400/Load_Shedding_Schedule_Ktm_30May2010.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">(Click on the picture to see full view)</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">After being choked by blogger for around 20 days for being marked as spam for no apparent reason, this is a new blog post.</div><br /><blockquote>Enjoy the less load shedding.</blockquote></div>
