I am not looking at the negative sides of things but there are huge productivity cuts due to the FIFA World Cup 2010. During just this one month, the British economy will loose $ 7.36 Billion and United States will loose 121.7 Million in productivity. 3% plan to report sick and stay back home to watch the match, this may not be the case in Nepal.<br /><br /><a href="http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/1410/productivityinfographic.png" title="worldcup-productivity-nosedive" target="_blank"><img alt="worldcup-productivity-nosedive" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4757910658_56f98ca1d9_b.jpg" /></a><br /><b>(Click on image to view Full size - 1000 px wide - Opens in new tab/window)</b><br /><br />Source: <a href="http://www.insideview.com/productivity-world-cup.html" target="_blank">http://www.insideview.com/productivity-world-cup.html</a> -  (opens in new window/tab)<br /><br /><blockquote>Without doubts, its the biggest sports festival with 80% of the world's population watching the games with an average of 95 million viewers per match.
