<div class='post'>
I recently just surfed through <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/copy-great-designers-steal" target="_blank">this </a>post at SitePoint, simply it starts like:<br /><blockquote><br />Pablo Picasso, the first living artist to be featured in the Louvre, influenced the artistic world in a uniquely original way. So why is he known for saying “Good artists copy, great artists steal”?<br /><br />It’s true. Picasso really said, “Good artists copy, great artists steal.” Or at least, since his death in 1973, everyone believes he said that.<br /></blockquote>Now in this context I surfed 2 sites and amazingly found the design ditto same, I like the design its clean and flexible here are the two sites <a href="http://www.drupalroom.com" target="_blank">http://www.drupalroom.com</a> and <a href="http://www.pokharacity.com/" target="_blank">http://www.pokharacity.com</a> below:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SK44dVLvg0I/AAAAAAAAAdQ/A1SIQ4YAWjI/s1600-h/Drupal_Room_Small.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SK44dVLvg0I/AAAAAAAAAdQ/A1SIQ4YAWjI/s400/Drupal_Room_Small.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5237185493232223042" border="0" /></a>DrupalRoom.com<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SK44-ttzkHI/AAAAAAAAAdY/y4OL6g7a9NM/s1600-h/Pokhara_city_small.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SK44-ttzkHI/AAAAAAAAAdY/y4OL6g7a9NM/s400/Pokhara_city_small.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5237186066753228914" border="0" /></a>Pokharacity.com<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div><br />I don't know who stole the design from whom. If <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">its a common template then I just wasted my time</span> but how can two sites have the same theme/look and feel/skin is just a question in my mind. How??? Getting inspired may be a different ball game but ditto copy is....</div>
