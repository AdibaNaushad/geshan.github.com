<p>Karthik Calling Karthik an unconventional name for a hindi movie but a break from a long wait for some outstanding music. Lately I have not heard anything to say it sounds amazing and this album break my wait for a great sound track which has it all.</p><br /><h2>Intro</h2><p>Reportedly called to be a <b>psychological thriller</b> the promos are scintillating and Deepika looks beautiful and sultry in the movie preview. Let’s follow what the music by the terrific trio of Shankar Ehsan Loy (SEL) has in store for the average listener like me.</p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S1NK2V8nJzI/AAAAAAAABSY/XV1ALwO_zVg/s1600-h/Karthik_Calling_Karthik_Front_Small.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S1NK2V8nJzI/AAAAAAAABSY/XV1ALwO_zVg/s400/Karthik_Calling_Karthik_Front_Small.jpg" /></a><br /></div><br/><br /><h2>Songs</h2><p>KCK starts off with “<b>Hey Ya!</b>” a very enticing title and equally grooving music to set the foundation of things to come. Rendered almost flawlessly by the trio of <i>Clinton Cerejo, Shankar Mahadevan and Loy Mendonsa</i> it lacks Ehsan of the music director trio who has composed and arranged the music for this flick. Mainly Clinton’s voice rules this slow but punchy track with marvelous music and lyrics is simply exceptional – “Mujhko dunya milgayi hai – zindagi badal gayi hai – Tum jo mere saath ho”. The promos on screen look so inviting and the on screen pair also looks good.</p><p>Next track is “<b>Uff Teri Adda</b>” crooned in incredible fashion by Mr. breathless himself <i>Shankar Mahadevan</i> and well supported by <i>Alyssa Mendonsa</i>. With some upbeat percussion and synthetic sounds this is surely going to be a hit dance number. Even the lyric talks about breaking a leg, the incomparable singing by Mahadevan makes this song a masterpiece. The varying pace of this track also gives a different feel to the listener.</p><p>“<b>Jaane Ye Kya</b>” vocalized by <i>K.K</i> follows, it is a slow melodious track with subtle earthy instruments. It has a simple composition and unsophisticated lyrics describing of being together.</p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S1NK9sqyrsI/AAAAAAAABSg/VD-soGhmrX8/s1600-h/Karthik_Calling_Karthik_Back.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S1NK9sqyrsI/AAAAAAAABSg/VD-soGhmrX8/s400/Karthik_Calling_Karthik_Back.jpg" /></a><br /></div><p>Then the mesmerizing voice of <i>Kailash Kher</i> is next, when he croons “<b>Kaisi Hai Ye Udasi</b>”. Starting with bansuri (flute) this song has simple composition and soft percussion with a narcotic voice makes this song addictive from the word go. Superior lyrics and superb back vocals by Sukanya Purayastha creates a memorable effect for this song. Lyrics for all the songs in this album have been penned by Javed Akhtar.</p><p>At Track 5 the title track “<b>Karhik Calling Karthik</b>” arrives, sung by <i>Suraj Jaggan, Shankar Mahadevan, Caralisa Monteiro and Malika Singh</i> is a haunting song that reminds that this flick is a psychological thriller. Intriguing composition and experimental arrangement makes this song sway away from the groovy or easy listening category. Karthik and pick up the phone is the best part of the song. Lyric is also unusual and keeps the listener guessing on what the movie will be all about.</p><p>Consequent track is an instrumental “<b>Karthik 2.0</b>” a fast paced rock number which stands out as the theme of the movie. Put together by <i>Midival Punditz and Karsh Kale</i> who is also giving the background score of the movie, the track gives a sense of being in middle of some trouble and something fishy happening around.</p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S1NLWqGsWsI/AAAAAAAABSo/Ra5r_dkFEIs/s1600-h/coverinlay02_small.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S1NLWqGsWsI/AAAAAAAABSo/Ra5r_dkFEIs/s400/coverinlay02_small.jpg" /></a><br /></div><br/><br /><h2>Remixes</h2><p>Then the first of the three remixes in the album comes “<b>Karthik Calling Karthik – Theme Remix</b>” is still as haunting as the original. The track is done by <i>Midival Punditz</i> who has in the past given great remixes and this track is also a groovy number that may be a good track to shake your booty to. This 4/4 beat song can be a good party started. With majority of synthetic sounds and loud percussion there is some voice parts well weaved in this high tempo track.</p><p>Subsequently surfaces  “<b>Hey Ya! Remix</b>” sung by the trio who sang the original song, this track has a hip-hop feel to it in the music department. With some jazzy vocal effects this song promises to be the next dance anthem. High on percussion but still maintains the hip feel of the song. <i>Digital Boyz</i> have done a marvelous job of remixing the track.</p><p>Last track/remix is “<b>Uff Teri Adaa – Remix</b>”  - starts off with heavy beats and give the dance feel from the first beat punched. Punchy and groovy the splendid voice of Shanker and astounding supporting vocals of Alyssa Mendonsa dissolves seamlessly in the fast paced 4/4 beats like sugar in hot water. You will not able to keep yourself from dancing if this song plays in a night club. The remixing is credited to <i>Udyan Sagar (Nucleya)</i> who has executed the job without flaws.</p><h2>Verdict</h2><p>On the whole, I’d like to repeat I listened to a great album after a long time. The <b>singer selection by Sharkar Ehsan Loy compliments to the outstanding music they have composed and arranged</b> for this album. The multitalented Farhan Akhtar looks great in the promos and lyrics are also commendable by the word smith Javed Akhtar. Midival Punditz have a fair share in the collection but they will prove their musical mettle in the background score department is what I’m expecting.</p><br /><blockquote>This album in my opinion must make it to your music collection as one of the best albums by Shankar Ehsan Loy (SEL), so go and garb it. <br /></blockquote><h2>Extra :)</h2><p>PS: This is a music review by me after 16 months, why?
