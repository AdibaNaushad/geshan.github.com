Saturday morning, woke up late and what a day to relax as its a holiday. Then the usual thing flipped through a daily (let's not name which ;) but you can find out if you have seen it yesterday from the picture below). Then got my eyes set on a review a movie review, my eyes ran through it, it was not a long one but it left me dissatisfied for sure.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SlCo5QvV8ZI/AAAAAAAABCw/ZWENCVWrGF8/s1600-h/movie_review_2_blurr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 335px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SlCo5QvV8ZI/AAAAAAAABCw/ZWENCVWrGF8/s400/movie_review_2_blurr.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5354965658643067282" border="0" /></a>I am not a movie buff nor do I follow all movies but at times I do read movie reviews. I read movie reviews to know how the movie is and also to know how its written. As far as I read about reviews and how to write them a review should talk about all the aspects of the product/service the review is of. But to my surprise I don't know why, mainly the reviews I read in news papers are just not satisfying. Even some I read online are not good as well.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SlCpsNFimlI/AAAAAAAABC4/DnMyZ36AseQ/s1600-h/movie_review_blurr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 293px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SlCpsNFimlI/AAAAAAAABC4/DnMyZ36AseQ/s400/movie_review_blurr.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5354966533835758162" border="0" /></a>I believe people will flock the theaters if they find good words given by great movie reviewers/critic like Taran Adarsh.<br /><h4>Lets look at what regular reviews are focused on:</h4><ol><li><span>Some parts of the story is revealed<br /></span></li><li><span>Some comments on central characters  are made<br /></span></li><li><span>Some suggestions on acting skills are given</span></li><li>Some dress up sense and fashionista advice is showered. </li><li>May be some things on the music, location and similar things.<br /></li></ol>I don't think it is justified, a movie is very big thing there are lots of people behind a movie. Why don't so many people even don't get mentioned for their work. I know all can't be listed but some major ones who don't appear on the screen deserve some compliments, comments and suggestions.<br /><br /><h4>Reviewers/critics should also write about following things:</h4><ol><li>How well did the choreographer do?</li><li>How was the background music and were the songs aptly placed etc?</li><li>How well did the supporting characters supported the screenplay?</li><li>Any real flaws in the story?</li><li>How as the pace of the movie? how could it have been made better?</li><li>All other technical aspects editing, special effects use, sound things, camera angles?</li><li>Cast selection, comparisons etc...</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">the list can be endless but there are other things to write not just the central characters and the script/story.</span></li></ol>Having said that, most people just read the regular reviews that I read. They just want to read how the actors look in the movie, whats the plot of the movie. I sense it is the reason such reviews are written and will be written.<br /><br /><blockquote>Most reviews I read are like a rubber stamp, I may be wrong, there may be outstanding critics who see what most of us miss but I urge them to write it down as well. I guess this may being the change in writing better and ingenious review which stand out and do justice. </blockquote></div>
