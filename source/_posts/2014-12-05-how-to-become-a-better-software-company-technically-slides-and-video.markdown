I was in Kathmandu,Nepal for a week at the end of November and this time I talked about how to become a better software
company technically at [YIPL](http://yipl.com.np) on 24-Nov-2014.

Generally the software scene in Nepal is good, a handful are working at big scale with hundreds of software engineers
and many are small with some developers. A thing I noticed talking with developers is that mostly is only about **making
things work**. The need to follow a proper release cycle with [gitflow](http://bit.ly/1xy61E6), or even follow a
defined issue flow and testing it in multiple environments is not felt.
<!-- more -->

Same feelings are shared when it comes to things like code quality, code review, automated testing, consistent virtual
dev environment shared between developers and generally automation. The pressing need for such methodologies and tools
are not felt which in turn decrease developer productivity.

My talk was an introduction to methodologies and tools I have used in the past 3 years that help developer productivity
and establish a better project management culture.

The main themes of this talk was as follows:

* Process Management
* Software Quality
* Automation
