<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Facebook has become a part of our daily life, some use it wisely, some are addicted to it but you use it. It was not of a big surprise that facebook has more photos than <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> but more than 12 times was a surprise for me. And if you go by the predictions <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> will have even more photos than what it has now.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Other highlights about the photos on facebook are the number of photos&nbsp;uploaded&nbsp;on weekends are higher than week days, <b>6 billion photos are uploaded every month</b>, obviously women upload more photos than men on facebook. Full list of things in the info-graphic&nbsp;below:&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/5386/photoinfograph.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/5386/photoinfograph.png" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Facebook has 12 times more photos than Flickr</td></tr></tbody></table><br /></div><blockquote>Facebook Engineers must have a tough job to keep the servers up and running in this amount of load. But what can you do when the company is valued at around <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jan/03/facebook-value-50bn-goldman-sachs-investment" target="blank">$ 50 billion</a> now.</blockquote></div></div>
