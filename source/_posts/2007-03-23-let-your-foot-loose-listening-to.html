Ltd is a relatively long name for a flick but <b style="">the initial promos were humorous and expressive</b>. Vishal-Shekhar’s dynamic duo has given a variety of numbers in this album but they have <u>their creativity centered on dance tracks</u>. The cover design is relevant and revealing the back cover even gives the artists who have played instruments, programmed songs etc in the album which is <b style="">different as well as respectful</b> to the artists behind the curtain. The mix of blue, pink and brown for <b style="">Sea, Love and Sand</b> is impressive on the covers. The fun conveying snaps of the jodis with the signature bus in the cover and inlay covers of the CD is articulate. The <i style="">six jodis on the cover remind us of a recent film</i> but here the married percent is cent percent.  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Album kicks off with the first aired song entitled <b style="">“Sajna Ji Wari Wari”</b> which is sung by <i style="">Sunidhi Chauhan</i> mainly and <i style="">Shekhar Ravjiani’s</i> name is also visible in the color. Capivating techno beats seamlessly blended with <u>conventional instrumentation</u> with formidable lyric makes this song <u>stick to your head and your mouth</u> from the word go. It’s a short song but has the punch to put you down in one listen. Subsequently, we get to enchant our ears with <b style="">“Jaane Hai Woh Kahan”</b> which portrays the vocal skills of the talented <i style="">Shreya Ghosal</i> and effervescent <i style="">Shaan</i>. The use of <u>synthetic percussion and regular instruments</u> has added the extra zing to the song which already has a commendable lyric by <b style="">Javed Akhtar</b>. Akhtar has inked the lyrics of all the songs in this album. Next on the list is <b style="">“Albela Albela”</b> which is executed by Mr. Breathless himself <i style="">Shankar Mahadevan</i> and <i style="">Vishal Dadlani</i> with elegance. The rap back vocal supports the song’s dance feel. The <u>lyric is amazing</u> and the song on the whole makes you want to <u>jump on the dance floor</u>. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>At track 4 the sweet music of guitar runs down the ear with the song <b style="">“Halke Halke”</b>. This emotion provoking lyric of this track is vocalized by <i style="">Neeraj Sridhar</i> from the Bombay Vikings fame. The singer has <u>uttered the words with grace</u>. The music is simple and very easy to the ears. <u>Melody grips your heart effortlessly</u> and the upbeat instrumentation is simply astounding. Consequently <i style="">Sunidhi Chauhan</i> and <i style="">Gayatri Iyer</i> have amazingly executed the song titled <b style="">“Pyaar Ki Ek Kahani”</b>. The salsa type music makes you <u>want to shake a leg</u>. The <u>earthy but powerful lyric goes in sync with the will to do tango</u> in the jive. After it we have <b style="">“Haath Dhore Niye Chalo”</b> which has a Bengali title I suppose. This is an <u>instrumental track</u> to be more precise produced by Funcinternational. This has all the <u>qualities of a techo/ house type music with the typical 4/4 beats</u>. The words in the beginning and some parts of the music make it ideal choice for a background piece and a good track to end the party in style. Last but not the least, we have <b style="">“Halke Halke Remix”</b> by <u>Neeraj Sridhar</u> again. This time the <u>tempo has been increased and significant amount of percussive beats</u> have been added. This is a dance floor friendly track for sure. <span style=""> </span><span style=""> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>All in all, this is a good effort by Vishal-Shekhar which I sense goes comfortably in sync with the movie. There are just above half a dozen tracks with one remix and one instrumental but most of the tracks are dance numbers which is fun. <b style=""><u>Variety in similarity</u></b> is highlighted by the dynamic duo in this album. If <u>you have liked prior album by the music director duo then you can be missing something if you don’t have this album</u> till date.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 204, 0);" class="MsoNormal">Geshan Manandhar</p>  <p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">Around 625 Words</p>  Also posted on Mouthshut.com at <a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Honeymoon_Travels_Pvt_Ltd-119776-1.html">http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Honeymoon_Travels_Pvt_Ltd-119776-1.html </a><br />From the name of System_Shadow but Written by Me.<br />For more see:<br /><a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/user/system_shadow/1.html">http://www.mouthshut.com/user/system_shadow/1.html</a></div>
