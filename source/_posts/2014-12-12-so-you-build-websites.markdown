"It was great doing business with you, I hope your new website will help you to attract more business.", you generally tell these words when you handover the completed website to your client. Businesses build websites to gain more work or if it's an online business then the whole business depends on it. In any case as developers who build websites, using technology we enable clients to meet their business goals. In this context, as a web shop if you can provide something more for free to your clients it would add value to your service and a bigger smile in your client's faces.

I am not referring to the obvious free add ons like Google [Analytics](http://google.com/analytics) or doing some basic Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and be an initial submission to Google [Webmaster Tools](http://google.com/webmaster-tools). They should be taken for granted for each website you develop. It is like something that needs to be done for each website you build as a great web shop. Having a solid back-end (if need be) and a great user experience (UX) will make your uhappy following the tips below will make them even happier.

## Automatically report any downtime
As a new business whose website is just launched to production it would be a concern to make sure it is up and running 24/7. For this use a freelancer service like [uptime robot](http://uprimerobot.com). You can setup 50 monitors for free that ping, ports or even keywords on the given website to check every 5 mins.

As a web shop, if you setup monitors for all your websites it will be easier to manage from the same account. Depending on your location you can setup SMS alerts. If you use [pushbullet](http://pushbullet.com) you can setup alerts with push bullet.

If you provide web hosting for your clients it will help alert that the website is down via email. Only reporting downtime is surely not enough, it is your chance to prove yourself by providing world class service and fixing the issue as soon as possible.

## Google Analytics report as infographics
As mentioned earlier you have added free Google Analytics tracking for iclient's website, still the client might not be proactive to check it now and then. So why not provide them with a digest of the analytics tracking information via email as infographics. You can do it using [Visual.ly GA ](http://visual.ly/), which takes less than a minute to setup and you get great visualization of Google Analytics data delivered to your inbox every week.

The report informs about page views, visitor information etc. For full reports the clients can always go to the main Google Analytics website or use the [app](http://play.Google.com) to check site analytics on the go.

## Free Dashboard
If my website just went live, I would love to see some key metrics about my website on a single screen, a dashboard. Information like is the website up now, how many people are currently on the website, how many page views did the website get yesterday etc would help.

![Freeboard.io Dashboard](/images/freeboard.jpg "Freeboard.io Dashboard")

To portray such information you could utilize [Freeboard](http://freeboard.io). Get the latest version of Freeboard from [github](http://Github.com/freeboard) and host it on your own or on something like dashboard.clientsite.com, password protect it and load necessary data.

A basic dashboard should be given free if the client wants more you should bill it.

## Conspire email report - Bonus
If your client uses Gmail or Google Apps for email you could suggest and help setup a weekly report of their email contacts and email usage behavior using [Conspire](http://conspire.com).

It helps to analyze who you contacted the most in the past week and who you are loosing touch with. It also informs about how long you and your contacts took to reply to emails. Your clients can use conspire to connect with new people and expand their businesses.

>I hope these tools help you provide valuable add-ons free to your clients to retain your clients and expand your web shop.
