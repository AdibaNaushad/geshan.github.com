<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Sixteen, lively and pretty Marcia Adhikari is all set to hit the Nepali music scene like a storm down under. Defining music as a form of expression and her passion she also dreams to make it big in the acting domain in the future after joining a film school. Though without any formal training but her voice quality and American accent will make you listen to her songs again and again. For that you will have to wait till October or November 2008.<br /><br />Currently perusing her International Baccalaureate (IB – equivalent to our +2) at Pathways Worlds School, Delhi, she was here for her vacations after the exams. She practices at free time <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SJcTLUgYF3I/AAAAAAAAAbM/c5Tbk5_ZrXA/s1600-h/Marcia_3.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SJcTLUgYF3I/AAAAAAAAAbM/c5Tbk5_ZrXA/s320/Marcia_3.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5230670577418114930" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px;" /></a>with her guitar. Marcia is also interested in sports like basketball, squash and swimming. SheRocker Marcia giggles and utters she plays soccer as well but sometimes only. Being in India for a decade and having majority of friends from abroad made her accent so American she articulates. A fan of rock music she mainly grew up listening to artists like Avril Lavigne, Audio Slave and Monologue, she is currently humming songs by Kate Voegele. Considering her future in acting she likes actors like Angelina Jolie, Jenifer Aniston, Saif Ali Khan and Imran Khan to name some. So this complete package is someone to reckon with who has the potential to take over the Nepali music scene.<br /><br />Her album named “Man Mero” comprises of 8 songs, she points out it’s of Soft Rock and Alternative Rock genre. All the song’s lyrics have been penned by Durga Lal Shrestha except Sakdina whose lyric is written by Marcia herself. All the songs have been composed by Nhyoo Bajracharya. She informs “Man Mero”, “Ke Bho, Ke Bho” and “Sakdina” are the tracks in her album she likes more. Planning to make a couple of videos from her album she exclaims that she will model in the videos but not now it will be done when she comes back in her next vacation. Being supported by family and friends she urges all the people to listen to her album not by force but she expects they will find something in her. We wish her all the best for her album and videos.<br /><br />Photographed By: Raj Bhai Suwal </div><br /><br /><blockquote>This was my first interview with a lady (girl).
