The song provided a dance vibe from the word go plus it was set in a club setting. The compilation is <u>Heyy Babyy why two ys in both words I think Sajid Khan the VJ turned director knows</u>. About the album, the cover is scintillating with the four lead actors but Vidya Balan is looking as pretty as ever. The lyrics given in the inlays is a good example set, the pictures in the inside are also glittery. Shanker Ehsan Loy (SEL) this time also <u>have given the old formula of mixing fast paced songs and slow soothing numbers</u> in the same album.   </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>The album kicks off with the title track <b style="">“Heyy Babyy” </b>stylishly vocalized by <u>Niraj Shridhar, Raman, Prevez Quadir and Loy</u>. This is a full on dance track with techno beats and sultry lyrics to accompany the overall feel of the movie of the three out of control guys. Next is “<b style="">Dholna</b>” magnificently crooned by the deadly duo of <u>Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghosal</u>. Its great to hear Sonu after a long time and Shreya was also out of lime light after Leja Leja. The song has earthy instrumentation and that first love feel written all over it. Sameer has penned down <b style="">commendable lyrics</b> for this song and for the whole album except of the variation of the title track by Girl Band. After that soothing track, we come across <b style="">“Mast Kalandar”</b> which is sung by <u>Salim Shehzada, Rehan Khan, Shankar Mahadevan and<span style="">  </span>Sajid Khan</u>. The instrument selection is unsophisticated and gives you the wedding song feel from the first Shenai hear. Singers have done full justice with the compilation and the lyric goes in sync with the melody. This song provokes you to put on your dance shoes. Subsequenly, “<b style="">Heyy Babyy</b>” vocalized by <u>Girl band featuring DJ Akbar Sami</u><b style=""> </b>enchants our ears. Girl Band comprises of <u>Renee Armstrong, Patrice Tipaki, Renee Bargh & Jessica Smith</u>. Pakistani singers have had been featured in bollywood movie albums but now its time for the singers from the west. It is a typical Akbar Sami dance track with high tempo and addictive 4/4 beats. The English lyric is provided by Anvita Dutt Guptan and Girl Band. Consequently <b style="">“Jane Bhi De” </b>reaches our ears which is sung by <u>Shankar Mahadevan and Loy Mendosa,</u> I can’t figure our why they missed Ehasan. Well the duo from the terrific trio has done a fine job of singing their own composition. The song has the apologetic lyric and the rhythm is one you start humming from the first listen. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>At track 6 we have <b style="">“Meri Duniya Tu Hi Re” </b>which is crooned by three shining S of the bollywood music scenario <u>Sonu, Shaan and Shankar</u>. This is by far the best slow song in the album, I think its shot on the baby and her three fathers. The song has amazing lyric with the slow pace that builds up as the song passes by. Then there are three remixes, first remix is “<b style="">Dholna Remix</b>” by <b style="">DJ WhoSane. </b>It<b style=""> </b>is<b style=""> </b>a slow mix of the orginal song without the dance type heavy beats but the DJ has done enough to keep the soul of the song intact. The English rap adds the needed zing to this remix but Sonu’s voice stands out even in the RnB type music. After that we have <b style="">“Heyy Babyy Big O Mix” </b>which is also re-arranged by <b style="">DJ WhoSane. </b>This<b style=""> </b>remix unlike the above one is fast paced and can be called a dance mix with amplifying the heat of the original. The out of the box experiments in sound should have been avoided it will stop the song from being a big club hit. Last but not the least is <b style="">“Jane Bhi De Hiccup Remix” </b>by <b style="">DJ WhoSane </b>which is a proper Rap Mix of the original. With the increased tempo, good beat-matching and extra voices being mixed up this song can become a disco burner in near future.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>All in all, this album is a good one from the trio who has given big hits. It is not as good as the other compilations they have put their hands in but ok for collecting one SEL album. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p></b></p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Around 750 Words</p></div>
