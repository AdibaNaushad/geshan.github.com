<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Last week when I was in Kathmandu, Nepal I did a talk at <a href="http://prime.edu.np/" target="_blank">Prime College</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PrimeCollegeEdu" target="_blank">college</a> where I did my bachelor (undergraduate) and my Plus 2. The talk was about &#8220;Things I wished I knew while doing my bachelor / undergraduate&#8221;.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtKoXBoap4Q/VAHJsvUvyJI/AAAAAAAA1VY/i_yQa3M_AxI/s1600/IMG_6212.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtKoXBoap4Q/VAHJsvUvyJI/AAAAAAAA1VY/i_yQa3M_AxI/s1600/IMG_6212.JPG" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br />This talk was about how to use your bachelor to craft your tech career. I started with what I have done and some examples of where my friends have reached. Then I focused on things to consider for selecting and doing projects for technical subjects in bachelor study.<!-- more --><br /><br />After that I opened up the secrets of selecting a company and doing internship. To concluded I gave some tips on approaching the job market. I think the talk went good and I was able to convey my message correctly to all the participants. I hope the students will benefit from it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ANWhlgkDt30/VAHMMEwkPII/AAAAAAAA1Vs/OootCd-ErEc/s1600/IMG_6214.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ANWhlgkDt30/VAHMMEwkPII/AAAAAAAA1Vs/OootCd-ErEc/s1600/IMG_6214.JPG" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Attentive Students</h3><div>Thankfully the bachelor students who attended the talk were very attentive and inquisitive towards what I was presenting.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Call them programmers or developers or software engineers, in this technology centered world, your life is a easier also because of them. If you notice you are addicted to technology in all aspects of your life now a days, you wake up when the alarm app rings on your phone, all day at work you are constantly checking email, after work you connect with your friends on facebook, before sleeping you browse through the news. All these activities are possible because one or more programmers wrote some working code and released the application that you are using on your desktop, laptop, mobile etc.<br /><br />It is structured words like the one you see below that is changing how we live in the current times.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gLCd12P09gA/U8DvGaAZfaI/AAAAAAAA0nM/nl47mw5l_wU/s1600/sample-php-code.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gLCd12P09gA/U8DvGaAZfaI/AAAAAAAA0nM/nl47mw5l_wU/s1600/sample-php-code.png" height="390" width="640" /></a></div><!-- more --><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">How do programmers make the world go round?</h3>You just beeped your smart card at the metro/train station entrance, it showed you the current balance n the card on the small screen, how? Someone coded the software for the embedded system to detect the NFC chip and saved your valuable time and effort. There are other countless examples on every nook and corner you go today. You are able to catch up to the fast paced life because someone thought of a software solution to a problem and other people spent hours coding the right solution for it.<br /><br />When I worked for a Travel reporting system for UNICEF in Kathmandu, Nepal, it was a pleasure to know that after implementing the new system the reimbursement of travel expenses was 40% faster. I think each programmer/developer/software engineer whose project has gone live has one or more similar experiences.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Due respect to other professionals</h3><div>Surely it is only only about programmers, like doctors save lives, engineers help build houses, pilots fly the plane. If you look at any profession software has changed how things are done now and how it was done some years back. Think of a banker who had to record all data on paper registers, now can simply enter the data to this awesome system and it is reported till the balance sheet.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I would also like to convey my due respect to all other tech related jobs including systems analysts, project managers, data architects, system administrators they are all very important parts of the puzzle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">We need more programmers a.k.a super hero world changers :)</h3>I watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA" target="_blank">video</a> below some times back and I think people should know that their live is a bit more easy because great ideas were successfully executed by talented programmers.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nKIu9yen5nc" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />Computers are everywhere in all fields, so we will be needing more rock stars (programmers) who can transform from ideas on papers to real life applications that can be used by many people.<br /><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Programmers are addicted to code</h3>Starting to code is not easy and taking it as a profession does require lots of passion, determination and devotion. It takes lots of learning with hours and hours of thinking and making things work. After you pass the initial phase of how do I make it work then you start getting addicted to coding. It is an amazing feeling that you can build something and you dive deeper into it. It requires lots of problem solving and creativity to get things done and get it done right. I recently read &#8221;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/suzanne-ma/computer-programming-women-html500-vancouver_b_4739610.html" target="_blank">How I hacked my husband&#8217;s code addiction</a>&#8221; which explains how programmers behave at times.<br /><br />All in all it is this passion and addition to code which keeps programmers glued to their machines hours on hours to come up with something productive and useful. That mobile app you think is helping you a lot was build by some programmers who had to go through lots of hard work to get the thing working. So respect the devotion, time and effort put in by programmers and other tech professionals.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Programmers deserve a big thank you</h3><div>Regardless of the language used, the product platform or the audience scope, all programmers deserve a <b>big thank you</b>. Thanks for all the free apps I got to use, for the endless long hours programmers have put to get things work, ripping your hair off to make that test pass and seeing the tests turn green at midnight, &nbsp;for all the free and open source code that helped all other programmers. Hats off to your hard work. Keep up the good work and making the world a better place.</div></div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Bootstrapping a tech start up with limited financial resources is always a difficult task in hand. You have to find the right balance between the cost and the benefit of the money spent. As a new entrepreneur if you could get some great software for the price of 0 that would really expedite the tech related company bootstrapping process.<br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>In this context lets discuss about some free software that will really help you get some amazing benefits. I would like to keep this post as programming language agnostic as possible. Subsequently, I believe though you don&#8217;t need to pay for the software a good web host will be necessary that provides shell and software installation access (like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon AWS</a> or <a href="https://www.linode.com/" target="_blank">Linode</a>) to install the software mentioned later in this post.<br /><br />This post is going to cover software/SAAS for Project Management , group chat and notification, source code collaboration with version control (git), deployment automation and error/log monitoring of the deployed application.<!-- more --><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9jKOshkGQoM/U6PbcQcg40I/AAAAAAAA0fs/KugrkesoILg/s1600/5-apps-for-bootstraping-tech-stratup.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9jKOshkGQoM/U6PbcQcg40I/AAAAAAAA0fs/KugrkesoILg/s1600/5-apps-for-bootstraping-tech-stratup.jpg" height="400" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">The Apps</h2><h3 style="text-align: left;">Redmine for Project Management</h3><div>Redmine is a flexible <a href="http://www.redmine.org/" target="_blank">project management tool</a> that can be self hosted on your own server. It helps you keep track of all the ideas, features and bugs that pertain to your application. It is very flexible and configurable to the flow you want to choose for your project management. If you follow an agile, scrum type approach with Kanban it can easily support that flow. If you are looking for free hosted project management tools you can have a look at <a href="http://www.trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> or <a href="http://www.asana.com/" target="_blank">Asana</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DYvgFZjlSss/U6PQd8o7UeI/AAAAAAAA0fc/6BgGRcXblJA/s1600/redmine.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DYvgFZjlSss/U6PQd8o7UeI/AAAAAAAA0fc/6BgGRcXblJA/s1600/redmine.png" height="327" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Hipchat for Group Chat and Notification</h3><div>Hipchat is an amazing <a href="http://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank">chat application</a> that support one to one and group chats, it is great to search your previous chats online and integrates very well with other applications. A real world use case is our deployments are notified on Hipchat. They have a paid plan as well but the free plan is enough to start with. Interestingly they have apps for <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/download" target="_blank">all relevant platforms</a>. If you still want to go old school you can opt for <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank">Skype</a> or good old Google chat.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BItraTwu45k/U6PbiHHoskI/AAAAAAAA0f0/3yhpxFMUNgg/s1600/hipchat.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BItraTwu45k/U6PbiHHoskI/AAAAAAAA0f0/3yhpxFMUNgg/s1600/hipchat.png" height="400" width="398" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">GitLab for private git hosting</h3><div>Git is a distributed version control system which is flexible, configurable, popular and very useful to put your source code under version control. If you follow a good <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank">git flow and branching</a> model it can be very productive for your team. As a startup if you don&#8217;t want to pay for private git hosting at <a href="http://www.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a>&nbsp;community edition is a very good self hosted alternative or hosted at <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up">Gitlab.com</a>.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">From the last time I blogged it has not changed much for the most popular brands and people on Facebook. Age group of <a href="http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-statistics/nepal" target="_blank">18-24 account for almost 50%</a> of Nepali Facebook users and 67.7% of all users are men so only 1/3 users are female. The top 3 brands in Nepal on Facebook are the same as <a href="http://geshan.blogspot.ae/2013/07/most-popular-brands-people-in-nepal-on.html" target="_blank">6 months before</a>&nbsp;still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/AECCGlobal" target="_blank">Australian Education &amp; Career Consultants</a> has overtaken <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AceTravel" target="_blank">AceTravels.com</a> to come to No. 2 position and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ncell" target="_blank">NCell</a> came out at top as the last time.<br /><br />This kind of analysis should have been done by a social media analyst company, but I doubt if there are any online marketing companies in Nepal which do such analysis. Anyways,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcsajhasawal" target="_blank">Sajha Sawal</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnepaliservice" target="_blank">BBC Nepali</a> have emerged as the most liked Facebook pages for entertainment and media category respectively. Looks like BBC is very popular in Nepal.
