<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Last week when I was in Kathmandu, Nepal I did a talk at <a href="http://prime.edu.np/" target="_blank">Prime College</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PrimeCollegeEdu" target="_blank">college</a> where I did my bachelor (undergraduate) and my Plus 2. The talk was about &#8220;Things I wished I knew while doing my bachelor / undergraduate&#8221;.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtKoXBoap4Q/VAHJsvUvyJI/AAAAAAAA1VY/i_yQa3M_AxI/s1600/IMG_6212.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZtKoXBoap4Q/VAHJsvUvyJI/AAAAAAAA1VY/i_yQa3M_AxI/s1600/IMG_6212.JPG" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br />This talk was about how to use your bachelor to craft your tech career. I started with what I have done and some examples of where my friends have reached. Then I focused on things to consider for selecting and doing projects for technical subjects in bachelor study.<!-- more --><br /><br />After that I opened up the secrets of selecting a company and doing internship. To concluded I gave some tips on approaching the job market. I think the talk went good and I was able to convey my message correctly to all the participants. I hope the students will benefit from it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ANWhlgkDt30/VAHMMEwkPII/AAAAAAAA1Vs/OootCd-ErEc/s1600/IMG_6214.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ANWhlgkDt30/VAHMMEwkPII/AAAAAAAA1Vs/OootCd-ErEc/s1600/IMG_6214.JPG" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Attentive Students</h3><div>Thankfully the bachelor students who attended the talk were very attentive and inquisitive towards what I was presenting.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">What is common between Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Linked in? If you are looking for the answer its <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>&nbsp;the Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) that has simplified software revision control. Its major <a href="http://git-scm.com/about" target="_blank">features</a> are speed and performance combined with ease of use provided you know the basic git concepts.<br /><br />If you are new to git you should read some <a href="http://geshan.blogspot.ae/2012/02/git-introduction-and-hand-on-usage.html" target="_blank">getting started</a> tutorials or if you have used SVN you should read <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git" target="_blank">migrating to git</a>. For the audience of this post, I assume that you are already using git for some time and are familiar with concepts like commit, push a branch, pull changes from remote repository, merging a branch to &#8220;master&#8221; and similar daily things that git users normally do.<br /><br />Git is a lot more popular than SVN or Mercurial. If you take check Google trends in the past 5 years (July 2009 - July 2014) in Internet and Telecom category, git it twice or move as popular as the other two:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MYWJgIxDJRo/U9Xant4rMHI/AAAAAAAA0rM/6e3mV34bYX0/s1600/git-vs-svn-vs-mercurial.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MYWJgIxDJRo/U9Xant4rMHI/AAAAAAAA0rM/6e3mV34bYX0/s1600/git-vs-svn-vs-mercurial.png" height="452" width="640" /></a></div><!-- more --><h2 style="text-align: left;">More on Git</h2><div>I started using git in early 2009, then I has little experience with SubVersion (SVN) and git was a refreshing change to slow and difficult SVN. At that time, we did not do much branching or follow the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank">git flow</a>&nbsp;branching model.<br /><br />I rediscover the power of Git in 2012 when I joined <a href="http://www.namshi.com/" target="_blank">Namshi</a> where we were a bigger team than I used to work with and Git made total sense. We were also using a revised git flow with lots of branching, merging, rebasing and tagging for releases.</div><div><br /></div><div>Recently I watched a video &#8220;Git happens&#8221; by&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/jessitron" target="_blank">@Jessitron</a>&nbsp;and I refreshed the git concepts. This <a href="http://jessitron.github.io/git-happens/" target="_blank">video</a> is great not only that she is talking about git, also because it&#8217;s not a presentation she uses a whiteboard, markers and some sticky notes to make all the most important git concepts very clear to you. If you are using git I really recommend watching this:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/46010208?portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe><br /></div><div><br />And remember when using Git, its about telling the story of your project, how you and your team decide it will help maintain and informative history of your project.&nbsp;</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">The Tips</h2><div>Some Git tips beyond the basics (commit, pull, push) are as follows:<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Diff (what changed?)</h3></div><div>So you are working on a new feature on your branch my-feature, before you commit, you do a git status to list your files, then you need to know what changed in the files you should do <b>git diff</b> on your working directory.

The same can be done with commit hashes.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Global Git Ignore</h3><div>If you use an IDE and it creates folders like .settings or .idea and you want to ignore it globally on all git repositories you can do it with global git ignore rather than adding it to each .gitignore file in each repository. You can create a file say <b>global_gitignore </b>on your home directory and list the folders and files you want to be ignored in all git repositories like:</div><div><pre class="shell" name="code">#global git ignore<br />.idea<br />.settings<br /><br />/test.txt<br /></pre></div><div><br /></div>Then run the following command you will have the above git ignore rules applied to all the git repositories:<br /><pre class="shell" name="code">git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global<br /></pre><br />There are a lot of other <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration" target="_blank">git configurations</a> you can try and tune git to meet your needs, if you want to look at the current configs applied to your git globally do <b>cat .gitconfig </b>on your home directory.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Stash your work</h3></div><div>You are working on feature-a, an urgent bug say bug-x is discovered and you need to leave what you were doing for feature-a and fix bug-x. What do you do with the changed files in branch feature-a that you were working on, you don&#8217;t wan&#8217;t to commit or push it as its a work in progress. Here comes git stash to your rescue, you can just stash what you were doing on branch feature-a and finish work of bug-x then come back to feature-a branch and pop or apply your stash. How?<br /><br /></div><div><pre class="shell" name="code">✹ ᐅ cd my-project<br />✹ ᐅ git checkout -b feature-a<br /><br /># working on feature-a, some files changed say 3 of them<br /># bug-x discovered, need to fix it urgently so let's stash changes<br /># (save them for later)<br />✹ ᐅ git stash save feature-a<br /><br /># lets go to master and create a new branch to fix bug-x<br />✹ ᐅ git checkout master<br />✹ ᐅ git checkout -b bug-x<br /><br /># work to fix bug x for 1 hr, its fixed now.<br />✹ ᐅ git add .<br />✹ ᐅ git commit -m 'bug-x fixed with change in config files'<br />✹ ᐅ git push origin bug-x<br /><br /># then open a pull request on github for bug-x,<br /># and come back to working on feature-a<br /><br />✹ ᐅ git checkout feature-a<br />✹ ᐅ git stash pop</pre># all your changed files are back and you are at the stage<br /># where you left it before fixing bug-x</div><br />Stash pop will remove the last stash, you can do &nbsp;<b>git stash list </b>to check all your stashes, stashes can be saved without name and can be applied with the hash. Check the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing" target="_blank">stashing</a> docs for more information, generally I follow the above flow for staging and prefer not having any stashes in the list.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Squash your commits</h3><div>You did this big feature taking 4 days work and as a good git user you did commits when the code was stable. So now you have 10 commits in total for the feature-b you worked in for 4 days. Do you really want to send a Pull Request with 10 commits, may be along the way you wrote some commits messages that are not so relevant now. So how do you get the 4 commits to become 1, its easy you squash your commits using&nbsp;<b>git reabse -i,</b>&nbsp;how?<br /><br />Now you have 4 commits (shown using <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/gitk" target="_blank">gitk</a> ) on top of master:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QhfIl3q029o/U9Xlc_2tD_I/AAAAAAAA0rc/6A0maq6LFKY/s1600/gitk-4-commits.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QhfIl3q029o/U9Xlc_2tD_I/AAAAAAAA0rc/6A0maq6LFKY/s1600/gitk-4-commits.png" height="522" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">you need to execute the following command:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><pre class="shell" name="code">✹ ᐅ git rebase -i HEAD~4 #the last number, here 4 is the no. of commits you want to squash.<br /><br /># you will get a screen like this :<br /><br />pick 8dd81e6 feature-b changes to the config files<br />pick 7ea892d Feature-a fixed class A b and C<br />pick a465749 Feature-b fixed tests<br />pick cd6f406 Feature-b fixed tests<br /><br /><br /># change all picks except of the first one to s. <br /># s is short for squash like below:<br />pick 8dd81e6 feature-b changes to the config files<br />s 7ea892d Feature-a fixed class A b and C<br />s a465749 Feature-b fixed tests<br />s cd6f406 Feature-b fixed tests<br /><br /># now exit your editor, if you are using vim :wq<br /># then as you are squashing commits you can select which commit messages to pick<br /># from a screen like:<br /># This is a combination of 4 commits.<br /># The first commit's message is:<br />feature-b changes to the config files<br /><br /># This is the 2nd commit message:<br /><br />Feature-a fixed class A b and C<br /><br />- [x] Works for A and B<br /><br /># This is the 3rd commit message:<br /><br />Feature-b fixed tests<br /><br />* fixed most test<br /><br /># This is the 4th commit message:<br /><br />Feature-b fixed tests<br /><br />- [x] fixed all tests<br /><br /><br /># Pick the ones that you need or delete, for this example I will not delete anything<br /># and quit the editor<br /><br /># 4 of your commits are squashed into 1.<br /></pre><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>If your commit squash was successful, you will see only 1 commit in place of the 4 on gitk with all commit messages intact, like:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JSpIRmrwP6w/U9XncahVmRI/AAAAAAAA0rw/1pZY7m7Kidg/s1600/gitk-4-commts-squashed.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JSpIRmrwP6w/U9XncahVmRI/AAAAAAAA0rw/1pZY7m7Kidg/s1600/gitk-4-commts-squashed.png" height="640" width="614" /></a></div></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2><div>This is just scratching the surface of git there are lots of other things that can be done with git, like <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick" target="_blank">cherry pick</a> commits, list <a href="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/2345/show-git-branches-by-date-useful-for-showing-active-branches" target="_blank">git branches sorted by created date</a>, <a href="http://webchick.net/node/99" target="_blank">bisect</a> for debugging, you have to know how to <a href="http://githowto.com/resolving_conflicts" target="_blank">fix conflicts</a> with tools like <a href="http://meldmerge.org/" target="_blank">meld</a>&nbsp;etc.<br /><br />Then you have <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks" target="_blank">git hooks</a> which open up a new world of its own like having pre-commit hooks to <a href="http://carlosbuenosvinos.com/write-your-git-hooks-in-php-and-keep-them-under-git-control/" target="_blank">do checks of code and run tests</a>. Git has also been used to version control text related projects like <a href="https://www.gitbook.io/" target="_blank">books</a> not only code. So the possibilities are endless and if you are not using Git you are missing on a lot of things.</div></div></div>

    <id>http://geshan.github.io/blog/2014/07/18/3-bundles-to-get-started-with-rest-in</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&#8220;I found out that you guys just build an amazing mobile app for your e-commerce venture, I heard you are using Symfony 2 for your back-end APIs. How did you make it that fast?&#8221; This is not very different that what I was asked some months back. The answer is we use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture" target="_blank">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) </a>where all back-end service follow the REST architecture to communicate with all the clients. The client can be built in any language as longs a they can do HTTP calls. Lets look at what Symfony 2 bundles you can use to build a similar scalable, fast and cacheable REST APIs.<br /><br />I assume that you have some experience with Symfony 2 including how to use <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md" target="_blank">composer</a> to download dependent libraries/bundles.<br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">What is REST</h2>REST, short form for&nbsp;Representational state transfer is a resource based client and server communication protocol which is stateless and cacheable. It is an abstraction over HTTP communication where emphasis is given on uniform interface to make the communication structured and consistent. This <a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html" target="_blank">video</a> describes the constraints of REST and explains what it is or read a simpler <a href="http://rest.elkstein.org/2008/02/what-is-rest.html" target="_blank">one</a>.<!-- more --><br /><br />REST is a lightweight substitute to older ways of doing web services like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call" target="_blank">Remote Procedure Call</a> (RPC) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP" target="_blank">Simple Object Access Protocol</a> (SOAP). Basically communication in REST happens in light weight format like JSON which makes it fast.<br /><br />Describing REST involves having knowledge if the HTTP methods (verbs) like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Before proceeding further <a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html" target="_blank">knowing</a>&nbsp;what are they used for will be essential. There is also lots of fuss about <a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/restfulresourcenaming.html" target="_blank">how to name resources</a> (and corresponding URIs) but rather than doing things by the book making it logical and practical can be the best solution.<br /><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">RESTing With Symfony 2</h2><div><a href="http://symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony</a> is a very loosely coupled framework which has lots of useful components structured in easily plug-able bundles. Here are 3&nbsp;useful public Symfony 2 bundles for your next project using REST with Symfony.</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">FOSRestBundle</h3><div>The <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/FriendsOfSymfony/rest-bundle" target="_blank">FOSRestBundle</a> provides a solid foundation to start building RESTful services in Symfony 2. It can provide with automated routing for resources (probably doctrine entity if you use doctrine). It provides a very good base for a format (JSON/HTML/XML) independent view layer.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>If you want to be able to encode or decode multiple format <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle" target="_blank">FOSRestBundle</a> recommends using <a href="https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSSerializerBundle" target="_blank">JMSSerializerBundle</a>. The serializer bundle is like glove on the hand with FOSRestBundle to give out response in JSON/HTML/XML. Please go through the <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.md" target="_blank">documentation</a> very well and for custom routing you can use Symfony routing and not the one provide by FOSRestBundle. It is one of the most popular bundles in <a href="http://knpbundles.com/best" target="_blank">KNPBundles</a> and has been downloaded more than 784K times.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dSAVmuiGqgw/U8i7PyW6H6I/AAAAAAAA0ns/w7KSttIS_VE/s1600/fos-rest-bundle.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dSAVmuiGqgw/U8i7PyW6H6I/AAAAAAAA0ns/w7KSttIS_VE/s1600/fos-rest-bundle.png" height="410" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">NelmioApiDocBundle</h3><div><a href="https://packagist.org/packages/nelmio/api-doc-bundle" target="_blank">NelmioApiDocBundle</a> is a boon when developing REST web services on Symfony2. The <a href="https://github.com/nelmio/NelmioApiDocBundle" target="_blank">bundle</a> enables clean documentation of all API end points by just using some structured annotation. There are at least 2 amazing benefits using this bundle, first you can give the link to the docs (generally /api/doc) to anyone who wants to implement the REST API you have created. Second while developing you can test your API with the sandbox feature provided by this useful bundle, if you use the annotations correctly linking the involved forms.</div><div><br /></div><div>Restricting sandbox with user access might be a good feature to add on on this bundle. Reading the full <a href="https://github.com/nelmio/NelmioApiDocBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.md" target="_blank">documentation</a> is highly encouraged. It is also a very popular bundle with 473K downloads till date.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dPLuYKdnhWc/U8i9kyXe7cI/AAAAAAAA0n4/kUl3jGfiU3M/s1600/nelmio-api-bundle.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dPLuYKdnhWc/U8i9kyXe7cI/AAAAAAAA0n4/kUl3jGfiU3M/s1600/nelmio-api-bundle.png" height="520" width="640" /></a></div><div><h3>LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle</h3><div>As discussed REST is stateless, so for authentication you have to opt for some mechanism that can be communicate with each request. You can go for something like <a href="http://oauth.net/" target="_blank">Oauth</a>&nbsp;or use JSON Web Signature (JWS). There is already a public bundle the&nbsp;<a href="https://packagist.org/packages/lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle" target="_blank">LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/namshi/jose" target="_blank">JOSE</a> library built at Namshi. It is recommended that you read about JWS and JSON Web Token (JWT) before using this bundle. It can be used by putting the token as a cookie for each request.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>It will enable role based access to your API end points, lets say you want normal users to create users and only admin users to update/delete users that will be easily possible using this <a href="https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle" target="_blank">bundle</a> than trying to generate a time limited key or some other type of authentication. Yes, reading the <a href="https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.md" target="_blank">documentation</a> of the bundle will help you achieve the desired output.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WL-v27TBctg/U8jEeA0dvPI/AAAAAAAA0oM/3n8Smx-h-KQ/s1600/jwt-bundle.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WL-v27TBctg/U8jEeA0dvPI/AAAAAAAA0oM/3n8Smx-h-KQ/s1600/jwt-bundle.png" height="342" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I hope these modules will come in handy when you start your REST Api with symfony. For more features and to leverage REST to the fullest you can take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/willdurand/BazingaHateoasBundle" target="_blank">BazingaHateoasBundle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hautelook/TemplatedUriBundle" target="_blank">TemplatedUriBundle</a>.</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Other Tips</h2><div>Some other things you can consider when building a REST based API with Symfony 2 are:</div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Use the validation groups in Symfony 2 and keep all the validation conditions as annotation in the Entity itself than at multiple places.</li><li>Keep the handing of forms central, though you will not show any HTML forms for the purpose of validation use the Symfony forms on top of the entities and link them to controllers which expose the end points.</li><li>Use the HTTP status code wisely like when a resource is created its not 200 OK its 201 Created, when you are paging results 206 will make for sense and if the user sent bad data 400 Bad Request is better.</li><li>&nbsp;Think how will you version your API early when you develop your API if today you use /api/V1 how will you use api/V2 and what will be its consequences.</li><li>Last but not he least be liberal on what you accept and strict on what you give out.</li></ol><div><blockquote>All in all Symfony is a great framework and doing REST in Symfony though not a piece of cake but is challenging yet rewarding.&nbsp;</blockquote></div></div></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Call them programmers or developers or software engineers, in this technology centered world, your life is a easier also because of them. If you notice you are addicted to technology in all aspects of your life now a days, you wake up when the alarm app rings on your phone, all day at work you are constantly checking email, after work you connect with your friends on facebook, before sleeping you browse through the news. All these activities are possible because one or more programmers wrote some working code and released the application that you are using on your desktop, laptop, mobile etc.<br /><br />It is structured words like the one you see below that is changing how we live in the current times.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gLCd12P09gA/U8DvGaAZfaI/AAAAAAAA0nM/nl47mw5l_wU/s1600/sample-php-code.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gLCd12P09gA/U8DvGaAZfaI/AAAAAAAA0nM/nl47mw5l_wU/s1600/sample-php-code.png" height="390" width="640" /></a></div><!-- more --><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">How do programmers make the world go round?</h3>You just beeped your smart card at the metro/train station entrance, it showed you the current balance n the card on the small screen, how? Someone coded the software for the embedded system to detect the NFC chip and saved your valuable time and effort. There are other countless examples on every nook and corner you go today. You are able to catch up to the fast paced life because someone thought of a software solution to a problem and other people spent hours coding the right solution for it.<br /><br />When I worked for a Travel reporting system for UNICEF in Kathmandu, Nepal, it was a pleasure to know that after implementing the new system the reimbursement of travel expenses was 40% faster. I think each programmer/developer/software engineer whose project has gone live has one or more similar experiences.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Due respect to other professionals</h3><div>Surely it is only only about programmers, like doctors save lives, engineers help build houses, pilots fly the plane. If you look at any profession software has changed how things are done now and how it was done some years back. Think of a banker who had to record all data on paper registers, now can simply enter the data to this awesome system and it is reported till the balance sheet.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I would also like to convey my due respect to all other tech related jobs including systems analysts, project managers, data architects, system administrators they are all very important parts of the puzzle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">We need more programmers a.k.a super hero world changers :)</h3>I watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU1xS07N-FA" target="_blank">video</a> below some times back and I think people should know that their live is a bit more easy because great ideas were successfully executed by talented programmers.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nKIu9yen5nc" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />Computers are everywhere in all fields, so we will be needing more rock stars (programmers) who can transform from ideas on papers to real life applications that can be used by many people.<br /><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Programmers are addicted to code</h3>Starting to code is not easy and taking it as a profession does require lots of passion, determination and devotion. It takes lots of learning with hours and hours of thinking and making things work. After you pass the initial phase of how do I make it work then you start getting addicted to coding. It is an amazing feeling that you can build something and you dive deeper into it. It requires lots of problem solving and creativity to get things done and get it done right. I recently read &#8221;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/suzanne-ma/computer-programming-women-html500-vancouver_b_4739610.html" target="_blank">How I hacked my husband&#8217;s code addiction</a>&#8221; which explains how programmers behave at times.<br /><br />All in all it is this passion and addition to code which keeps programmers glued to their machines hours on hours to come up with something productive and useful. That mobile app you think is helping you a lot was build by some programmers who had to go through lots of hard work to get the thing working. So respect the devotion, time and effort put in by programmers and other tech professionals.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Programmers deserve a big thank you</h3><div>Regardless of the language used, the product platform or the audience scope, all programmers deserve a <b>big thank you</b>. Thanks for all the free apps I got to use, for the endless long hours programmers have put to get things work, ripping your hair off to make that test pass and seeing the tests turn green at midnight, &nbsp;for all the free and open source code that helped all other programmers. Hats off to your hard work. Keep up the good work and making the world a better place.</div></div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">A software engineer tells to a colleague in his team &#8220;Man, it is working on your machine, but why is it not working on mine?&#8221;, then they both find out that one has Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with PHP 5.3 and the other software engineer on which the code is working is Ubuntu 14.04 with PHP 5.5 after some investigation. If you have ever faced this or similar problem its high time to switch to a portable and a reproducible virtual development environment shared among all team members. This is a context where <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> comes into play.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0ekdx2Cp0uU/U7esIpWAFVI/AAAAAAAA0kg/ezrqt-e-CVE/s1600/vagrant.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0ekdx2Cp0uU/U7esIpWAFVI/AAAAAAAA0kg/ezrqt-e-CVE/s1600/vagrant.png" height="360" width="640" /></a></div><br />If you have stack that involves many applications like PHP, Nginx, PHP-Fpm, Mysql, Rabbit Mq, Redis etc then making sure your team (even a small one with 3-4 members) have the same version for all above software will surely be a pain you don&#8217;t want to take care of.<br /><blockquote>This post is going to be developer&#8217;s perspective on using Vagrant as a virtualized development environment with minimal mention and coverage of the devOps and system side of Vagrant.</blockquote><!-- more --><h3 style="text-align: left;">What is Vagrant</h3>Vagrant is a container software that helps in creating virtual, lightweight, portable and reproducible development environment. Vagrant is a wrapper that can create a virtual machine using a provider like virtual box and a provisioner like puppet to create a server with exact requirements. It basically starts from a simple text file named Vagrantfile.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Why Vagrant</h3>There are many reasons to use a virtual development machine, some of them are:<br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>The <b>Vagrant virtual box is reproducible and portable</b> so all the team members share it and have the same development environment with all the software in desired versions.</li><li><b>Vagrant is OS agnostic</b>, it runs on Linux, Mac and Windows. The main thing is the virtual machine which is generally a Linux distro. So your software engineers can even use windows but have the same virtual box shared.</li><li><b>Vagrant saves time</b>, earlier it used to take at least more than one day to setup a development machine and all the applications. Now as the machine is already setup its the time it takes to download and build the machine. If you can build an automated installer for the application a new software engineer can get up and running in matter of hours and not day(s).</li><li><b>Updating existing software is easy</b>, if any software in the development stack changes lets say the team decides to use PHP 5.5 from PHP 5.4, the vagrant config is changed all users reload their vagrant machine and all team members have PHP 5.5.</li><li><b>Installing new software is easy</b>, lets say the team decides to use RabbitMq for messaging. RabbitMq can be added to the vagrant box in the vagrant config and all software engineers reload/reprovision their vagrant machines and all of them get RabbitMq.</li><li><b>Shared services, configs and file paths</b>, when you use vagrant the code base is in the host machine which is shared with the virtual box. The paths for all the application, application executable, services like nginx, mysql, configuration of the applications like error reporting in php.ini and even passwords like mysql root password are shared and consistent.</li></ol><h3 style="text-align: left;">Vagrant lingo</h3>To know Vagrant better you need to wrap your head around the Vagrant jargon. Here are some basic and important ones:<br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">Boxes</h4>A box is&nbsp;a package containing a representation of a virtual machine running a specific operating system, for a specific Provider. You can find a list of <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/" target="_blank">boxes</a> and start playing with them.<br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">Provider</h4><div>Providers are&nbsp;software responsible for creating and managing the virtual machines used by Vagrant. <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> and <a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank">Vmware</a> are popular ones. For this example we will use VirtualBox.</div><h4 style="text-align: left;">Provisioner</h4><div>Provisioners are used to set up the virtual server, installing all necessary software and executing different commands in sequence. The most used provisioners are <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/" target="_blank">Puppet</a>, <a href="http://www.getchef.com/chef/" target="_blank">Chef</a> and <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home" target="_blank">Ansible</a>. Shell Script is also a very common option. We will use Puppet for this example and a <a href="http://www.erikaheidi.com/blog/vagrant-usage-research" target="_blank">survey</a> says its used the most.</div><h4 style="text-align: left;">Vagrantfile</h4><div>Vagrantfile is the main entry point file to build the vagrant virtual box, it is used to define the base box and other config like the memory to allocate to the virtual machine etc. Other configs like host, forwared port, synced folder etc on this file.</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">More on Vagrant</h3>Vagrant is very useful software to have a standard and consistent development environment shared among the team of software engineers. It capsules the software stack and its config with users in a virtual box which is portable and easily reproducible. If you want to know more about refer to the official <a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/" target="_blank">docs</a> and this series by <a href="http://www.erikaheidi.com/" target="_blank">Erika Heidi</a>&nbsp;in <a href="http://www.erikaheidi.com/blog/a-begginers-guide-to-vagrant-getting-your-portable-development-e" target="_blank">part 1</a>, <a href="http://www.erikaheidi.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-vagrant-part-2-provisioning-and-puppet" target="_blank">part 2</a> and <a href="http://www.erikaheidi.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-vagrant-and-puppet-part-3-facts-conditional" target="_blank">part 3</a> is also great to know more about Vagrant.<br /><br />Vagrant also has alternatives, while many may argue that comparing Vagrant and <a href="http://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> is comparing apples and oranges. In case of having a virtual machine for dev only they can be the two alternatives. Some early problems I faced with docker is, because it is a Linux container data persistence is an issue. Also for the development environment I don&#8217;t think that linking 4 containers to get PHP, MySql, RabbitMq, Redis working is really practical.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">Google Trends - Web Search interest: vagrant, docker - Worldwide, Jun 2013 - May 2014 <a href="http://t.co/ZpijZyixPd">http://t.co/ZpijZyixPd</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/googletrendsexplore?src=hash">#googletrendsexplore</a><br />— Geshan Manandhar (@geshan) <a href="https://twitter.com/geshan/statuses/485291069819473920">July 5, 2014</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br /><br />If you look at the current popularity in Google they are performing head to head.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4vAwSP1jHao/U7eyrIRYlKI/AAAAAAAA0kw/CNKw9OLKabA/s1600/vagrant-vs-docker-June2013-May2014.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4vAwSP1jHao/U7eyrIRYlKI/AAAAAAAA0kw/CNKw9OLKabA/s1600/vagrant-vs-docker-June2013-May2014.png" height="435" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>As for now for my local development environment I am happy with Vagrant over Docker.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">PHP (LEMP) on vagrant, the easiest way</h3>In context of this post I will build and run a vagrant virtual box with LEMP - Linux Nginx Mysql and PHP with a GUI vagrant box builder <a href="https://puphpet.com/">Puphpet.com</a>. It is the easiest way as you just need to select what you need from the GUI get the file, then run vagrant up and you are done.<br /><br />This recipe is based on Network File System (<a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/nfs.html" target="_blank">NFS</a>) to share the project files from a Linux host machine which does not work in Windows. For this tutorial you will need to download and install the following prerequisites.<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a></li><li><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">Vagrant</a></li></ul><br />How you install the above two will depend on your OS and if the OS is 32 bit or 64 bit. TO get NFS on your Ubuntu run : <b>sudo apt-get install nfs-server.</b><br /><br />After you have VirtualBox, Vagrant and NFS server installed on your host machine (main system preferably Ubuntu), then you can go to <a href="https://puphpet.com/" target="_blank">Puphpet.com</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UvR3NCDOjIc/U7e2Cc2rr4I/AAAAAAAA0k8/Sd2AodP4_es/s1600/puphpet.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UvR3NCDOjIc/U7e2Cc2rr4I/AAAAAAAA0k8/Sd2AodP4_es/s1600/puphpet.png" height="360" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div>Follow the steps on the left one after the other, check &#8220;Locally&#8221; in &#8220;Where do you want your virtual machine?&#8221; part of the &#8220;Deploy Target&#8221; step. All other things are quite obvious, be sure to select &#8220;NFS&#8221; on the &#8220;Shared Folder Type&#8221; part. Please select &#8217;<b>../</b>&#8217; in&nbsp;<b>Box Sync Folder Source</b> part so that the vagrant and other projects can be placed on the same folder.<br /><div><br /></div><div>In the next section Server Packages, I added vim, git-core, htop and curl. You can add the packages you need.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ypuD3wxjV7Y/U7e4_rXmtzI/AAAAAAAA0lI/qQgCsJORbrA/s1600/puphpet-section-2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ypuD3wxjV7Y/U7e4_rXmtzI/AAAAAAAA0lI/qQgCsJORbrA/s1600/puphpet-section-2.png" height="361" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">You can skip the firewall section, in the WebServers section select Nginx, and define if you need more virtual hosts.

You should get an output like this <a href="https://gist.github.com/geshan/c00298ea22c2d56cd5be" target="_blank">gist</a>&nbsp;it will take some time to download the box depending on your internet speed and some more time to build the machine.</yourusername></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div>While the machine is being download and built, you can add the new hosts to your <b>/etc/hosts</b>. Add<br /><br />192.168.56.101 vagrant.dev<br />192.168.56.101 awesome.dev<br /><br />Then after the machine is up you can access <b>awesome.dev</b> provided the folders are placed correctly and the nginx virtual host is fine. If you have installed Rabbit MQ you can access the management plugin at&nbsp;http://vagrant.dev:15672 .<br /><br />If you want to check the virtual machine or execute commands in the new virtual box managed by Vagrant you can do a <b>vagrant ssh </b>and login to the virtual box with SSH.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Bootstrapping a tech start up with limited financial resources is always a difficult task in hand. You have to find the right balance between the cost and the benefit of the money spent. As a new entrepreneur if you could get some great software for the price of 0 that would really expedite the tech related company bootstrapping process.<br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>In this context lets discuss about some free software that will really help you get some amazing benefits. I would like to keep this post as programming language agnostic as possible. Subsequently, I believe though you don&#8217;t need to pay for the software a good web host will be necessary that provides shell and software installation access (like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon AWS</a> or <a href="https://www.linode.com/" target="_blank">Linode</a>) to install the software mentioned later in this post.<br /><br />This post is going to cover software/SAAS for Project Management , group chat and notification, source code collaboration with version control (git), deployment automation and error/log monitoring of the deployed application.<!-- more --><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9jKOshkGQoM/U6PbcQcg40I/AAAAAAAA0fs/KugrkesoILg/s1600/5-apps-for-bootstraping-tech-stratup.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9jKOshkGQoM/U6PbcQcg40I/AAAAAAAA0fs/KugrkesoILg/s1600/5-apps-for-bootstraping-tech-stratup.jpg" height="400" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">The Apps</h2><h3 style="text-align: left;">Redmine for Project Management</h3><div>Redmine is a flexible <a href="http://www.redmine.org/" target="_blank">project management tool</a> that can be self hosted on your own server. It helps you keep track of all the ideas, features and bugs that pertain to your application. It is very flexible and configurable to the flow you want to choose for your project management. If you follow an agile, scrum type approach with Kanban it can easily support that flow. If you are looking for free hosted project management tools you can have a look at <a href="http://www.trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> or <a href="http://www.asana.com/" target="_blank">Asana</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DYvgFZjlSss/U6PQd8o7UeI/AAAAAAAA0fc/6BgGRcXblJA/s1600/redmine.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DYvgFZjlSss/U6PQd8o7UeI/AAAAAAAA0fc/6BgGRcXblJA/s1600/redmine.png" height="327" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Hipchat for Group Chat and Notification</h3><div>Hipchat is an amazing <a href="http://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank">chat application</a> that support one to one and group chats, it is great to search your previous chats online and integrates very well with other applications. A real world use case is our deployments are notified on Hipchat. They have a paid plan as well but the free plan is enough to start with. Interestingly they have apps for <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/download" target="_blank">all relevant platforms</a>. If you still want to go old school you can opt for <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank">Skype</a> or good old Google chat.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BItraTwu45k/U6PbiHHoskI/AAAAAAAA0f0/3yhpxFMUNgg/s1600/hipchat.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BItraTwu45k/U6PbiHHoskI/AAAAAAAA0f0/3yhpxFMUNgg/s1600/hipchat.png" height="400" width="398" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">GitLab for private git hosting</h3><div>Git is a distributed version control system which is flexible, configurable, popular and very useful to put your source code under version control. If you follow a good <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank">git flow and branching</a> model it can be very productive for your team. As a startup if you don&#8217;t want to pay for private git hosting at <a href="http://www.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a>&nbsp;community edition is a very good self hosted alternative or hosted at <a href="https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up">Gitlab.com</a>. Gitlab has great features where you can manage repositories and user permissions, open pull request and collaborate by comments etc. If you are looking for a hosted alternative <a href="https://bitbucket.org/plans" target="_blank">BitBucket</a> gives a free 5 user unlimited private repository free plan.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CcnSosmignQ/U6PbmhQ4rLI/AAAAAAAA0f8/M7xusFq_8qA/s1600/gitlab.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CcnSosmignQ/U6PbmhQ4rLI/AAAAAAAA0f8/M7xusFq_8qA/s1600/gitlab.png" height="400" width="397" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Dploy.io for Continuous Deployment</h3><div>The more things you can automate the better it is from a cost point of view. Dploy.io is a hosted <a href="http://dploy.io/" target="_blank">continuous deployment service</a> that can deploy your code from Github or other git repo to Heroku, AWS and even your own server with SSH access or FTP and SFTP. It is easy to link the repository from sources like github and deploy it to the destination server. It makes the deployment quite easy and seamless which needs some initial configuration. For the free plan it allows one repository linked with unlimited destination servers and unlimited deployments.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WcjZkZTgHMQ/U6PbrwfYXnI/AAAAAAAA0gE/iiDRZR4t6o8/s1600/dploy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WcjZkZTgHMQ/U6PbrwfYXnI/AAAAAAAA0gE/iiDRZR4t6o8/s1600/dploy.png" height="380" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">NewRelic for Application Monitoring</h3><div>NewRelic is a handy <a href="http://newrelic.com/pricing" target="_blank">application monitoring and exception/error notification tool</a> which is useful for real time reporting of running applications. NewRelic is our go to app after each deployment to check if anything has gone wrong where it shows all the related errors and exceptions. NewRelic also provides information about application response times, deployment notification and other important information about servers as well. New Relic now also supports mobile apps monitoring which is a great new feature. The free plan gives 24 hours data retention. <a href="http://graylog2.org/" target="_blank">Graylog2</a> is an amazing log analyzing alternative but may need to be self hosted and <a href="http://loggr.net/" target="_blank">Loggr</a> looks quite promising as well.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J7YZ00fytU4/U6PdIb8-1dI/AAAAAAAA0gQ/FowbUidK1Bo/s1600/newrelic.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J7YZ00fytU4/U6PdIb8-1dI/AAAAAAAA0gQ/FowbUidK1Bo/s1600/newrelic.png" height="358" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">When you choose apps, you should also think of a smooth migration plan or an upgraded plan. It will help easy migration to a better vendor when needed.</div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2><div>Even for a start-up you will always need a good process and system in place. If you can automate your flows it would greatly help for the sustainability of the business. If the best practices for coding, testing and continuous integration can be followed by the development team with great software architecture and design it will make rolling out new features easy. Above application will help in achievement of these goals. &nbsp;</div></div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">In the past 12 months the popularity of AngularJs has exploded, which clearly hints that applications are being built following the multi-tire architecture. A good back-end API with a front end consumer application surely makes a capable duo that can handle any requirements of the application. If you have a multi-tire architecture then you don&#8217;t need to rebuild the back-end for serving data for other applications like a mobile application or any data requirement.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cR5rMFn2Eho/UvRkqrXlCDI/AAAAAAAAnes/JZThI0jhcS4/s1600/Selection_005.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cR5rMFn2Eho/UvRkqrXlCDI/AAAAAAAAnes/JZThI0jhcS4/s1600/Selection_005.png" height="369" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Popularity of Angular JS, source <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=angularjs%2C%20emberjs%2C%20backbonejs&amp;date=today%2012-m&amp;cmpt=q" target="_blank">Google Trends</a></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><!-- more --><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">Why Front-end applications?</h3>Front end applications with java-script run on the user&#8217;s browser, when the data interaction is moved to models and services supported by a framework it makes the front end application very powerful. This also enables the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank">Single Page Application</a> (SPA). Below are the <b>7 ingredients</b> of a great front end application with <b>Angularjs</b> being the main ingredient.<br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">AngularJs</h3><a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJs</a> is a &#8220;Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework&#8221; by Google which lets the developers abstract out the model view controller on front end (user browser) level. Its amazing <a href="http://sporto.github.io/blog/2013/04/12/comparison-angular-backbone-can-ember/" target="_blank">features</a> include two way data binding, routing and directives to name some. Angular with its <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/5-awesome-angularjs-features--net-25651" target="_blank">features</a> and flexibility might be your safest bet if you want to develop a front end application consuming data from a back-end API service.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-US25BlWq9Z8/UvRkyib883I/AAAAAAAAne4/a8AmMj7gORQ/s1600/angular_home.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-US25BlWq9Z8/UvRkyib883I/AAAAAAAAne4/a8AmMj7gORQ/s1600/angular_home.jpg" height="321" width="640" /></a></div><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">YeoMan</h3><a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a> is a scaffolding which provides generators that can speed up the application development process. It supports Angular, when combined with other great applications it helps you build your front end application with ease. It does the heavy lifting for you so that you can focus on the code better. As mentioned:<br /><blockquote>Yeoman is a robust and opinionated client-side stack, comprising tools and frameworks that can help developers quickly build beautiful web applications. We take care of providing everything needed to get started without any of the normal headaches associated with a manual setup.</blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-erIDXTqhAAE/UvRn2ftJlGI/AAAAAAAAnfA/K529macB_34/s1600/yeoMan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-erIDXTqhAAE/UvRn2ftJlGI/AAAAAAAAnfA/K529macB_34/s1600/yeoMan.jpg" height="446" width="640" /></a></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Bower</h3><div><a href="http://bower.io/search/" target="_blank">Bower</a> is a package manager for javascript projects. <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a> is the main dependency and package manger for PHP, similarly bower is the dependency manager for Javascript. It has a lot of packages which can be used for your project and managing the dependencies is matter of just one bower.json file on your project. You just do a bower install and all the dependencies are downloaded for you.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jqH0ALKrubw/UvRqdUkoNAI/AAAAAAAAnfM/2fif9_dsIsk/s1600/bower.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jqH0ALKrubw/UvRqdUkoNAI/AAAAAAAAnfM/2fif9_dsIsk/s1600/bower.jpg" height="318" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">GruntJs</h3><div><a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> is a javascript task runner, it can automate tasks so that you can focus more on the development. In relation with AngularJs it can be used to start the server, check file changes to compile with the new changes and perform auto reload, check for JSLint, run your tests etc. You can configure the tasks in a grunt file and utilize its powerful API to create your own tasks.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-smmph9DImZs/UvRqdhJFmOI/AAAAAAAAnfk/NSDyhxvQIVQ/s1600/gruntjs.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-smmph9DImZs/UvRqdhJFmOI/AAAAAAAAnfk/NSDyhxvQIVQ/s1600/gruntjs.jpg" height="340" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Jade</h3><div>Now you have a good separation of your front and and you are coding some javascript model, services and controller. How would you manage the view/template part of the application. There are many options like <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">Handelbars</a>, <a href="http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/" target="_blank">Swig</a>&nbsp;(similar to <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">Twig</a>&nbsp;in php) but using <a href="http://jade-lang.com/" target="_blank">Jade</a> might be easier.&nbsp;Jade is like a compressed version of HTML which makes writing templates much easier and faster. Jade files can be compiled to output as HTML with a grunt task.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9XOB_4jdzFE/UvRqeLf0hZI/AAAAAAAAnfo/KnnmSRPq3JA/s1600/jade-html.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9XOB_4jdzFE/UvRqeLf0hZI/AAAAAAAAnfo/KnnmSRPq3JA/s1600/jade-html.jpg" height="338" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Compass CSS</h3><div><a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank">Compass</a> is a open source CSS authoring framework that use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> to make writing CSS logical, easy and painless. It is like making CSS programmable with variables, nesting styles and other features which helps on making CSS code reusable and maintainable.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Writing testable code is a harder target to achieve than just writing tests for the code written. You cannot write comprehensive tests that covers many function each of 200 or more lines and classes that measure 1000s of lines of code (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code" target="_blank">LOC</a>). Writing testable code is always important if you want to be able to test/unit test your code and be confident that nothing will break.<br /><br />Tests also help a lot when you re-factor some code or write new features. If all the tests are passing you are quite sure that nothing is breaking. Seeing all tests come out green is a very good sight for us software engineer.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mIzQVI5oxMU/Uuu1Bn0PmKI/AAAAAAAAndg/Wkq0HGPD1pM/s1600/all_green_tests.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mIzQVI5oxMU/Uuu1Bn0PmKI/AAAAAAAAndg/Wkq0HGPD1pM/s1600/all_green_tests.jpg" height="156" width="640" /></a></div><!-- more --><br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">Testing in PHP with PHPUnit</h2>Unit testing and testing as a whole is not a new thing in PHP, &nbsp;<a href="http://phpunit.de/" target="_blank">PHPUnit</a> the de facto unit testing framework in PHP started in <a href="http://gpfr.sourceforge.net/releases/phpunit-1.0.0/" target="_blank">2001</a>, The chart below shows that popularity of PHPUnit has really grown over the past years in comparison to <a href="http://www.simpletest.org/" target="_blank">Simple Test</a> another PHP testing framework.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iY16ziAjtiE/UuylucQEn-I/AAAAAAAAndw/cSZ9W2csjUM/s1600/phpUnit_popularity.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iY16ziAjtiE/UuylucQEn-I/AAAAAAAAndw/cSZ9W2csjUM/s1600/phpUnit_popularity.jpg" height="387" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;">Source:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=phpunit%2C%20simpletest" style="font-size: medium;" target="_blank">Google Trends</a></td></tr></tbody></table>PHPUnit is a great unit testing framework that can automate testing and help in getting optimal output. As they state in the <a href="http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/index.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>:<br /><blockquote>The difference between a good programmer and a bad programmer is that the good programmer uses tests to detect mistakes as soon as possible. The sooner you test for a mistake the greater your chance of finding it and the less it will cost to find and fix.</blockquote>It is true the sooner the problem is detected and fixed the better it is, same goes when some code is re-factored, a new feature is added or a bug resolved.<br /><h2 style="text-align: left;">Data Provider in PHPUnit</h2><div>There are may features of PHPUnit, which can help in writing comprehensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">unit testing</a> and moving toward the direction of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">test driven development</a> (TDD). Among them,&nbsp;<a href="http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/writing-tests-for-phpunit.html#writing-tests-for-phpunit.data-providers" target="_blank">data providers</a> provide arbitrary arguments to a test function so that same code can be used to test multiple scenarios and possible cases. In this very simple example I will use a part of checkout. The logic is very simple:</div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>If the payment method is &nbsp;&#8220;Cash&#8221;, apply a cash on delivery fee of 5.0</li><li>If the payment method is &#8220;Credit Card&#8221;, do not apply a cash on delivery fee.&nbsp;</li></ol><h3 style="text-align: left;">The part of the checkout class is given below:</h3><script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/geshan/dataprovider-example/blob/master/src/DataProvider/Example/Checkout.php"></script><br />Source: <a href="https://github.com/geshan/dataprovider-example/blob/master/src/DataProvider/Example/Checkout.php" target="_blank">Github repository</a><br /><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">The test for the above checkout class is given below:</h3><script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/geshan/dataprovider-example/blob/master/tests/DataProvider/Example/Test/CheckoutTest.php"></script><br />Source: <a href="https://github.com/geshan/dataprovider-example/blob/master/tests/DataProvider/Example/Test/CheckoutTest.php" target="_blank">Github repository</a><br /><h3 style="text-align: left;">What makes using data provider in this example relevant and optimal?</h3></div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>As the test needs to be run for both &#8220;Cash&#8221; and &#8220;Credit Card&#8221; the only thing it changes here is the addition of cash on delivery fee.</li><li>There is just one test with the payment method being passed as a parameter, saving us from writing X no of tests for X no. of payment methods. So less code and more coverage.</li><li>The test is clear concise and understandable.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: left;">Things to consider in the code:</h3><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The test runs the as many times as the data set provided by the provider function.</li><li>@dataProvider annotation is necessary in the test to get the data sets from the provider function.</li><li>When writing the provider function, its better to comment who is using the provided data sets and the order of variables (check the comment of &nbsp;paymentMethodProvider method).</li></ul><div>Both the above files with composer.json is available as a public <a href="https://github.com/geshan/dataprovider-example" target="_blank">git repository</a> for your reference, you can check the <a href="https://github.com/geshan/dataprovider-example/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">read me</a> file to know how to run the tests.</div></div><h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2></div><div>Whenever you write tests and think, &#8220;Why am I writing a new test for the similar thing. I guess there can be a way to write less test/code and cover all my test cases.&#8221; Then is time to use data providers in PHPUnit. You save on time and effort to cover the cases, a new case is just another array in the provider function, even in case of new test cases being added its a one line change given the tests pass. I hope this helps you to write less test code and achieve more coverage.</div><div><br /></div></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">From the last time I blogged it has not changed much for the most popular brands and people on Facebook. Age group of <a href="http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-statistics/nepal" target="_blank">18-24 account for almost 50%</a> of Nepali Facebook users and 67.7% of all users are men so only 1/3 users are female. The top 3 brands in Nepal on Facebook are the same as <a href="http://geshan.blogspot.ae/2013/07/most-popular-brands-people-in-nepal-on.html" target="_blank">6 months before</a>&nbsp;still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/AECCGlobal" target="_blank">Australian Education &amp; Career Consultants</a> has overtaken <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AceTravel" target="_blank">AceTravels.com</a> to come to No. 2 position and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ncell" target="_blank">NCell</a> came out at top as the last time.<br /><br />This kind of analysis should have been done by a social media analyst company, but I doubt if there are any online marketing companies in Nepal which do such analysis.

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[5 PHP Development Improvements Rediscovered in 2013]]></title>
    <link href="http://geshan.github.io/blog/2014/01/10/5-php-development-improvements/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-10T11:27:00+04:00</updated>
    <id>http://geshan.github.io/blog/2014/01/10/5-php-development-improvements</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Love it or hate it, the fact is <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/programming_language" target="_blank">80% of the web</a> is PHP and its usage has been in an increasing trend since 2010. Be informed that PHP is much better than you think as per&nbsp;<a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/article/64/php-is-much-better-than-you-think" target="_blank">Fabien Potencier</a>. As a <a href="http://tech.namshi.com/portfolio/" target="_blank">team</a>, we&nbsp;have worked a lot on PHP this year, specifically on <a href="http://symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony 2</a>&nbsp;mainly for our back-end APIs. It has really strengthen our multi-application <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture" target="_blank">SOA</a> platform and enabled us to build responsive front ends on top of it.<br /><br />In this process of having a robust back-end API, we have rediscovered and utilized some technologies inline with PHP development and improved on them in the past year. Here is a summary of these PHP related technologies/methods/best practices that will help all PHP developers:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MwFJBHH84Ww/Us-MFH60P6I/AAAAAAAAnTQ/1Y7qEnUuMCU/s1600/005PHP_Things.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MwFJBHH84Ww/Us-MFH60P6I/AAAAAAAAnTQ/1Y7qEnUuMCU/s1600/005PHP_Things.jpg" height="400" width="400" /></a></div><img /><!--more--><br /><h3>PHP Specification Request - PSR</h3>PSR (0-3) PHP Specification Request is a set of standards devised by the<a href="http://www.php-fig.org/" target="_blank"> PHP Framework Interoperability Group (FIG)</a> to standardize <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md" target="_blank">auto-loading</a>, <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md" target="_blank">coding standard</a>, <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide-meta.md" target="_blank">coding style</a> and <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-3-logger-interface.md" target="_blank">logger interface</a>. PHP-FIG members include big names like Zend, Symfony, Drupal to name some. We follow a slightly modified version of PSR-2 as our coding standards.<br /><br />Writing clean code is always helpful and if you follow a widely accepted coding standard it makes it easier to open source the code. To make the process better you can use <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer" target="_blank">PHP code sniffer</a> and integrate it with your IDE for code evaluation while you type.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Jp0OILLv7Lg/Us-HdQ5Mq-I/AAAAAAAAnTE/vMl0Z7gOV_4/s1600/01php_fig_psr.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Jp0OILLv7Lg/Us-HdQ5Mq-I/AAAAAAAAnTE/vMl0Z7gOV_4/s1600/01php_fig_psr.png" height="243" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>Composer and Packagist</h3>Composer is dependency management tool in PHP which lets you define libraries that your project is dependent on. <a href="http://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a> uses simple JSON declaration of dependent project in composer.json files and downloads the related libraries in the vendor folder. <a href="http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md" target="_blank">Getting started</a> in easy with compser and all the opensource packages are listed in <a href="https://packagist.org/" target="_blank">packagist</a>, where you can search for packages you need.<br /><br />Lets say if you want to work on Paypal and think someone might have submitted a wrapper library for Paypal Rest API, you can search and find the library that suits your need. You can even submit your library/package to be open source and used by others. Composer really makes working with dependency and managing version of the dependent library an easy task.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UfFC3YJNwQQ/Us-Nw55qorI/AAAAAAAAnTc/MPZ80brxYVc/s1600/02Composer_Packagist.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UfFC3YJNwQQ/Us-Nw55qorI/AAAAAAAAnTc/MPZ80brxYVc/s1600/02Composer_Packagist.jpg" height="228" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>Virtual Development Environment - Vagrant</h3><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> is a virtual development environment which works as a virtual machine on your main machine with all needed software stack as config. Basically it creates a reproducible and portable development machine which is shared by all the developers, that in turn eliminates &#8220;Works on my machine&#8221; syndrome.<br /><br />Another thing it greatly helps is the time to set up a machine and get running. In our case, it came down from around 2 days to install all the software stack and configure all environments to mere 5 hours including the download of all needed software. If you want your developer to start coding on the first day, this is your best bet as s/he does not need to install the correct version of PHP, MYSQL, X-Debug and all other software.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YPC1Uux4_Pk/Us-PYPwyIuI/AAAAAAAAnTw/8Rk1S9x3L1Q/s1600/03Vagrant.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YPC1Uux4_Pk/Us-PYPwyIuI/AAAAAAAAnTw/8Rk1S9x3L1Q/s1600/03Vagrant.png" height="192" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>Debugging with X-Debug</h3>Debugging in PHP used to be that elusive creature that you see sometimes and it just hides when you want to see it. On the contrary if you setup <a href="http://xdebug.org/" target="_blank">X-Debug</a> correctly on your machine (or your vagrant) you can run the debugger and inspect how your code executes line by line. Beware that its a correct mix of X-Debug, a client on your browser like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/easy-xdebug/" target="_blank">easy Xdebug</a> for firefox and a good IDE that supports debugging like <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">NetBeans</a> or <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank">PHPStorm</a>. Know well how to <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/xdebug-professional-php-debugging/" target="_blank">set it up</a>.<br /><br />In our case, X-Debug is installed on the vagrant machine so each developer does not need to manually install it. Just set up the preferred client on the browser and run the debugger on the IDE, then you can get new insights on how your code executes.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KeIbou7dBuc/Us-PV9FMkUI/AAAAAAAAnTs/7E9d2SpfdeQ/s1600/04Xdebug.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KeIbou7dBuc/Us-PV9FMkUI/AAAAAAAAnTs/7E9d2SpfdeQ/s1600/04Xdebug.png" height="258" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>Automated Testing with PHPUnit</h3>When your code is tested and all tests pass (they are green! yehh) you are confident that things will not break on the production environment. Writing test verify what the code is supposed do and it serves as animated documentation of the code. Not only does it help save the development time on the long run, you are already aware of the related things that break due the the changes you made when you coded a feature/fix. We use <a href="http://phpunit.de/" target="_blank">PHPUnit</a>&nbsp;to test on our PHP code so that we know all our features are performing how it should.<br /><br />I would not call our way of testing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">Test Driven Development</a> (TDD) or core <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">Unit Testing</a> of each class. Rather its our own way of ensuring that the feature works as intended. We code the feature first and then write the test to verify if it meets the requirements. We generally ensure that before sending a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">git hub</a> all the test pass.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ip-gzNysvCI/Us-UNflvzOI/AAAAAAAAnUA/rkH4w8Q9WX0/s1600/05PhpUnit.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ip-gzNysvCI/Us-UNflvzOI/AAAAAAAAnUA/rkH4w8Q9WX0/s1600/05PhpUnit.png" height="218" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">All in all 2013 has been a great year with lots of things to learn and explore, we experimented with many things as we raised our technical know how to a different level in terms of the tools we use. We went from a cron that runs every minute to <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank">Rabbit MQ</a> messaging queue that can be a different blog post :).</div><br /><blockquote>Now we follow continuous integration with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank">Travis CI</a>&nbsp;which runs the test we wrote with PHPUnit taking the code from Git Hub. I would like to thank <a href="http://www.namshi.com/" target="_blank">our</a> VP - Technology <a href="http://odino.org/" target="_blank">Alex</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/_odino_" target="_blank">@_Odino_</a>) for his vision and implementation of &nbsp;above mentioned technologies. Lets hope we see more advancement in 2014.</blockquote></div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I started my programming career as a software engineer/developer from a dev shop (I can&#8217;t find the right term for it, call it a dev shop, web agency, software house or web company anything that makes sense to you. Basically a agency/company that takes up projects to survive and grow). It was a small <a href="http://www.codeartsnepal.com/" target="_blank">web&nbsp;shop</a>&nbsp;with less people, however I was introduced to an open source web development <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">MVC</a> framework in PHP and a great deal to learn about how professional web and software development is carried out.<br /><br />After that in the entrepreneurial drive we gave <a href="http://www.younginnovations.com.np/" target="_blank">our company</a> a physical presence and put our heart and soul in building it, I worked there for 2 years plus in total and was involved in many projects. It was an amazing learning experience and I could see my growth. Then I went for my <a href="http://www.han.nl/opleidingen/master/en/information-systems-design/" target="_blank">masters</a>&nbsp;and after that joined <a href="http://www.namshi.com/" target="_blank">a company</a> in Dubai which is a product company (The company and the product is same, there are no projects as such, all it cares about is the product - nothing more nothing less). I&#8217;ve been working with this company for over a year now. I consider myself lucky to be working with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company" target="_blank">start-ups</a>,&nbsp;they really teach you lot of other things than only hard skills of coding and solving technical problems.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7vfPSp-E3sI/UbNDX6K8ydI/AAAAAAAAfjw/skXYKlAErS8/s1600/startup-sign.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7vfPSp-E3sI/UbNDX6K8ydI/AAAAAAAAfjw/skXYKlAErS8/s640/startup-sign.png" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Image Source : <a href="http://blog.brazencareerist.com/2011/07/14/so-you-want-to-work-at-a-startup-heres-how-you-do-it/" target="_blank">BrazenCareerlist Blog</a></div><!--more--><br /><br />This is not a story about where I worked, instead its a comparison of what I learned in the course of years of working as a developer or some other name to the role that involves at least some coding. Start-ups or established companies, small 2 people company or a company with hundreds of developers, the basic distinction you need to make is does the company take up client projects and deliver them or builds its own product to sustain itself in the market. Here are some of the differences you get when working for both the types of companies.<br /><br /><h3>Working for a dev shop</h3>Generally when you work for a dev shop you would generally experience the things mentioned below:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>You can decide on a new way of doing things from software architecture to design and data modeling as you start fresh you have all the decision to make. Basically its a clean slate where you draw the picture but in a team obviously.</li><li>In a single day you will work on 2-3 projects, code a feature for Project A, solve a bug in Project B and deploy (usually a <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">git</a> push and pull or upload files) for Project C.</li><li>In a new project you can start fresh choose your framwork (may be this time you want to go with <a href="http://www.symfony.com/" target="_blank">Symfony</a> 2 and not <a href="http://framework.zend.com/" target="_blank">Zend</a>, use <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> instead of <a href="http://www.jquery.com/">Jquery</a>). If you are in a decision making position you can do it, this will also depend on what client wants if s/he has a say and also the company policy.&nbsp;</li><li>Multiple project might have multiple frameworks or even languages (as mentioned above) in use and then you need to juggle all those.</li><li>Sometimes even though you are developer you will get to make your hands dirty with some system administrator (sys admin) job of setting up domain, domain name servers and space allocation for Project A.</li><li>Some other time the Front end guy&nbsp;+ designer is not available and you write 3 lines of CSS to fix that overflow in the image for client X. It happens like that ;). Same thing you should sometime open photo-shop and move that image 5 pixels to the right. (This will heavily depend on the team size and responsibilities, in a start-up it will be expected)</li><li>A project management methodology will be in paper at many times, collaborating among teams (basically front-end and back-end) becomes a challenge at times. Even release management is a myth ;).</li><li>You meet many people who voice their requirements and depending on if its a website or web app (a web software I mean), sometimes it becomes difficult to put a price to the effort.</li><li>On the management level, the company might lack a clear vision and goal (unless the company is funded by investors first question is how to sustain the company if its a start-up).&nbsp;</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YS42DNj5fVs/UbNKpaLKXKI/AAAAAAAAfkA/5bSjhzTN8Kk/s1600/Selection_003.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YS42DNj5fVs/UbNKpaLKXKI/AAAAAAAAfkA/5bSjhzTN8Kk/s640/Selection_003.png" height="363" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Image : An illustration what a single dev-shop can do.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div><h3>Working for a product company</h3></div><div>Things are quite different when you work for a product company, the company is the product as well as a company like Facebook, Twitter etc or the company has multiple products it sells in the market to sustain and grow. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_software_companies">largest software companies</a> are of this type like Oracle, SAP etc. The company does not have web projects (mainly web sites and web app/software) to deliver to the clients, it generally has only one or may be more products. The things you experience working for a product company are as follows:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>You are provided with an already built software and you need time to understand how its built, then you can code new feature in the software or solve bugs in it.</li><li>As a developer, there is not a way to completely change the software design, data model or the software stack as generally its already running. (May even be some legacy everyone is scared it would break if you tamper with it.)</li><li>All your ideas, solutions and energy is generally focused in one product, you even get to work on things like performance, optimization and things that enhance the whole product.</li><li>The frameworks, languages and guidelines for development are fixed and as a developer you cannot decide if you want to use Angular Js and not Jquery. (You will not change 1000 lines of Jquery for your whim.)</li><li>Generally you don&#8217;t get your hands dirty with system administrator or designer and front-end things, that is usually a no go territory.</li><li>Project management methodology is part of the system, you cannot really go far if you don&#8217;t have a issue tracking system. Release management, deployments and source code version control (like git our favorite) are backbone for any product company as products are generally big and many developers work on parts of it.</li><li>Requirements are given by the Product Manager or Project Manager and IT can be the central pivot to make the company roll.</li><li>On the management level, the goals and vision is clear. The company may not be a software house but how to sustain does not depend on how may projects you do and deliver so its much focused on the product.</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_hHoU6eTptg/UbNS0oenNjI/AAAAAAAAfkg/G5lYNARe_8M/s1600/Software-Companies.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_hHoU6eTptg/UbNS0oenNjI/AAAAAAAAfkg/G5lYNARe_8M/s640/Software-Companies.jpg" height="542" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Image: some big names in the software product company space</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t work for a pure software company now but without doubts its not a dev shop it is a product company. If you are looking for an internship or a job change, do think about the company you want to join is a dev shop or a product company. It&#8217;s a personal decision on what you want to do but now you are informed on generally what will be expected of you in a dev shop Vs a product company.&nbsp;</div><blockquote>In conclusion, I personally think its better working for a product company than a dev shop for the structured and managed way of working in a product company.</blockquote></div></div></div>

If there are multiple developers (be it one developer and one front end developer) you should consider using git.
