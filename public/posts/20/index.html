This seems to an over statement in current milieu but it may not be distant dream. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) association is a <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region></st1:place> based non-profit organization set up to oversee “The Children&#8217;s Machine” project and the construction of the 2B1 (laptop model) &#8220;$100 laptop&#8221; converts to around 7 thousand 5 hundred NC. Both the project and the organization were announced at the World Economic Forum in <st1:place st="on"><st1:city st="on">Davos</st1:city>, <st1:country-region st="on">Switzerland</st1:country-region></st1:place> in January 2005. The organization gained its most attention after Nicholas Negroponte (the founding chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Media Lab) and Kofi Annan unveiled a working prototype of the ‘CM1’ (another laptop model) in November 2005 at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, Tunisia. The whole project is the brain child of Mr. Negroponte.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="">   </span>This novel plan to develop a 100 dollar laptop and distribution to millions of school children of developing countries has caught the interest of governments and attention of many computer industry heavyweights. Some heavyweights supporting this praiseworthy causer are Google, Red Hat, AMD, Brightstar Corporation, News Corporation and Nortel Networks. Each company has donated two million dollars. The MIT Media Lab is also involved in the project.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>So, what is OLPC then? OLPC is a program to enable all children, everywhere, to have the best education possible. Creating and distributing inexpensive laptops will allow students to become more active and creative, letting them take their learning beyond the walls of their schools and off the pages of textbooks. These $100 laptops will serve as libraries, music studios, art galleries and communications devices, using an open-source software platform that the students can customize and expand as their learning needs and programming skills grow. These machines will permit students to move beyond static, information-centric views of computing and learning by providing a vehicle for experimentation and collaboration. All in all it will teach students how to learn from a wider perspective.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>Although no contracts with governments have been signed, Mr. Negroponte says current plans call for producing five to ten million units beginning in late 2006 or early 2007, with tens of millions more a year later. As from the map in the official website (http://laptop.org) <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> lies in yellow category that specifies those countries which are currently seeking government support. Therefore in the context of <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> we can encourage this project as it will uplift the education status of the whole nation. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>The Nepali localization of the OLPC project is “Mero Sanu Sathi”. Mero Sanu Sathi is the name given to the laptop that may be distributed to the school children of <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is not a technical project but an educational project which is of the child not for the child. This is the best way to revitalize and revolutionize our education system that runs at the pace of a tortoise. It does not teach the child but make them learn learning. We haven’t seen any government interest in this topic till date but some NGO’s and INGOs are warming up for this worthy initiative. Interested organizations in Nepal for implementation of this project include FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) Nepal Communtiy, Nepal Engineering College (NEC), UNDP, United Mission to Nepal, Education Network Nepal, Bellanet Asia/SAP International,<span style="">   </span>Curriculum Development Center,<span style="">   </span>IT- Resource Nepal (For More see http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Nepal) . But in these sorts of project government help and support is critical. The non government and private organization cannot make this kind of project reality. So I urge government and all concerned parties to support this noble cause.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>So may be in five to ten years the children going to school in <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region></st1:place> may be saying “Mummy mero saanu sathi ko battery sakiyo, charge garidinu na hai.”</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p><br />About 650 Words<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>

I had contributed an article for that mag in the past. I work till 1 AM to jot down the questions to ask the ever popular young and energetic band whose life performance I witnessed just two days back on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2006. I am a fan of jal for that matter.     <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            The day arrives, in the morning I’m informed to reach the parking of Hyatt at 10. I reach there on time, thing to consider is that I have an exam (viva) to give at 11:30 or 12:00. There seems to a miscommunication but we are informed that Jal has gone for a mountain flight. To no avail, we wait for an hour or so. Then the Jal’s manager inform us they are coming. He meant that they are coming down from their room but we scanned every incoming vehicle to sum up the work. Then Jal’s manager was behaving so good with us.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            After around two hours of endless waiting, the terrific trio of Jal finally arrive at the lobby of Hyatt. I run to the lead vocalist Salman Butt and ask him to give me few minutes. Goher is a litter far and Shazi is in his own world. Just as I begin to ask the first question the chameleon nature of the manager shows, he is so eager to move. Informs me that they are getting late. He had ensured that he will provide 10 minutes or so but I had to sum up the interview in just 1:45 mins with just two questions asked. I was so unsatisfied as my hard work was unjustified and I still had a exam to give. Another point to notice is that Mr. Butt didn’t feel the need to stop smoking while answering my question. Do you call this Jal (Manger mainly)’s disrespect to media or what? I really wished that they missed their flight!!!! A ray of hope they had the decency to wave us bye.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            The next day I get the anchor story of THT(The Himalayan Times) that ‘Jal’s manager is held with illegal notes’ I was so happy. Let’s put it aside but I’m a big fan of Jal. The way they treated a media person was reprehensible. If they had told they won’t give the interview we could have returned, they didn’t value our time. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            Nonetheless, today 27<sup>th</sup> December 2006 I again get a call when I’m returning home from college. I just find out that I have to interview the creative genius behind Jal – Goher Mumtaz only as others have returned and Manager is still in custody. I was per-informed about this so I had prepared the questions; I jump home print the question and head for the interview at 6. Reach a hotel at Jwalakhel and landed in Goher Mumtaz’s room. He was watching cricket at that time. This man is truly talented no doubts about that as he is the lyricist, lead and rhythm guitarist and above all composes the songs for Jal. Buts still on the contrary to my bitter experience 9 days back he is down to earth and humble. Primarily, the interview as very good, I have recorded it. He did smoke but had the decorum to blow the smoke away from me. A fine-looking tall gifted artist being perplexed by my question was what I enjoyed the most in today’s interview. All in all I must add you must set aside the emotion and feelings in professional life to a level, or it forbids you from giving your best shot. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">         <br />          This was the bitter and sweet experience I had with interviewing Jal. Hope it was likable. If I get the photos I’ll add them up.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p><br />Geshan Manandhar</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 650 Words</div></div></div>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RhCyDH5Rk9I/AAAAAAAAABo/W2pIrk3xGMU/s1600-h/925071447-5524104-1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RhCyDH5Rk9I/AAAAAAAAABo/W2pIrk3xGMU/s320/925071447-5524104-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5048730949010953170" border="0" /></a><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">         </span><span style=""></span>When I first heard “Chakna Chakna” on the TV promo I was thinking Himesh Reshammiya is appearing in the limelight after a while and his comeback is so lame. Then after hearing the full song and its remix I was satisfied with his doings. People who don’t keep up to their words are hypocrites so Reshammiya time and again told he will never act but his multi million project “Aap ka suroor” will hit theaters in some months I guess. Criticism apart lets scrutinize the album NamasteY London, why is the y there I don’t know. When I found out that Namastey London was an album with 18 tracks a 2 disk collection I thought I would never review it. The promos were scintillating so I decided to watch the move and it was ok but the music really excited me. The crux of the matter is there are only 7 tracks which as remixes and a new experiment by the maestro Mehfil mix with the legendary lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar reciting some lines himself. So all the lyrics are written by Javed Akhtar, music without doubts is by Himesh, remixes arranged by DJ Akbar Sami with rap by Arya. Cover informs the songs are recorded by Aamir Shaikh. The album is released and marketed by Eros music as film is under the banner of Eros Entertainment, it has all the codes for the ringtones and singtones you’ll need for a musical cell phone. </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>Ok now to the album, the cover is an eye candy. With enough information and being well versed the cover goes in sync with the whole album. The inlays has middle parted pictures of the two lead actors which seems nice, both disks are printed are printed with <u>same picture depicting the patriotic feeling that the film effervescently carries</u>. Lets <i style="">scrutinize the music of this elaborate album and put the 18 numbers under the scanner</i>. The album kicks off with the songs we first heard in the promos <b style="">“Chakna Chakna”</b> the guru himself as usual has sung this song. Lyrics are to the mark but the music seems unconvincing. Still Himesh relies on the 4/4 techno beats but the percussion does have that let’s dance effect on it. The <u>funjabi song with lyrics that depict love is misplaced in the bar</u>. Consequently, again it’s Reshammiya the singer trying to sing <b style="">“Viraaniya”.</b> This song has heartfelt tragic lyrics. Melody goes with the flow, the use of violin is formidable but at times you think the percussion is more than needed. Next we have <b style="">“Main Jahan Rahoon”</b> simply <u>my favorite track</u> of this compilation. It is amazingly executed by “<u>Rahat Fateh Ali Khan</u> and <st1:place st="on">Krishna</st1:place>”. Rahat the Pakistani music marvel has lent his voice to astonishing numbers like <i style="">“Lagan Lagi- Paap” and “Jiya Dhadak – Kalyug</i>”. The film kicks off with the remix version of this track I wanted it to be a love song but it turned out to be a patriotic one. Nevertheless, the music of the song is addictive; the balance between rhythm, melody and percussion is impressive. The singer scores on all grounds. About the lyrics, it can be said it depicts lots of love but for the country.<span style="">  </span></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p><br /><span style="">            </span>Subsequent track on the list Track 4 of disc 1 is <b style="">“Yahi Hota Pyar”</b><span style="">  </span>by <u>Himesh and Sunidhi Chauhan</u>. Lyric of this song are incredible focusing that love never looses hope. The singers have uttered the lyric in a remarkable fashion. Music of the song seems slow but goes very well with the theme of the song. One octave low but Himesh has proved his metal in different octaves. Following it we have <b style="">“Rafta Rafta” </b>it is credited to <u>R D B</u>. The song is well vocalized by the singers, it says Rafta Rafta but the words are uttered at a fast tempo. Music is the <u>regular Himesh techno theme</u> dance track kind but as the lyrics demands it has the earthy feel to it. The shortest song amongst the lot it measures 4:44. Next is “<b style="">Aanan Faanan”</b> it is astoundingly vocalized by <u>Jayesh Gandhi and Akriti Kakkar</u>. <u>Jayesh</u> has the popular track “<i style="">Ishq Ne- Ahista Ahista</i>” under his belt and Akriti has sung many tracks for and with Reshammyia. The songs has up beat lyrics, now <u>typical Himesh music is heard with the hard hitting beats and melody woven together</u>. Lyric of this is <i style="">change focused with all the things that change</i> in the film. The last real track of the album is “<b style="">Dilruba</b>”, it is effervescently sung by <u>Zubeen Garg and Alisha Chinai</u>. If I write about Alisha Chinai it will be never enough but <b style="">Zubeen</b> I noticed from “”Jane Kya – Pyar Ke side Effects” from then he <u>has lent his voice to many hip numbers</u>. He has a <u>narcotic voice</u> that goes inline with the song. The song has a romantic lyric but the music is in vogue and dance friendly. Reversely the <u>use of violin here also had added the extra zing to this song</u>. Again this songs also is placed in a club setting the <b style="">song’s lyrics is facing East and the song’s visualization is facing West</b>. Reshammiya still stick with the never fail formula of DJ friendly songs, which will be a hit if not they will be played loud in the discos because DJs will remix it what so ever. At track 8 and 9 of Disc 1 we come across <b style="">“Viraaniya Mehfil Mix”</b> and <b style="">“Aanan Fanan Mehfil Mix”, </b>Mehfil mixes are not that different mixes of the original they just have <u>Javed Akhter uttering some lines of his poems at the beginning and in the middle</u> as well and <u>more conventional instruments are added in the songs like the tabla</u> so I’ll skip the detail description of these tracks. On the contrary I’ll try to elaborate what I feel about the <b style="">remixes</b>. </p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>Jumping to Disc 2 now at the 10<sup>th</sup> track of the album the track 1 of 2<sup>nd</sup> disc, we stumble upon <b style="">“Chakna Chakna Remix”</b> I have had always liked the remixes of Himesh’s tracks that also mainly done by DJ Akbar Sami. DJ Sami has remixed all the tracks including this one. This particular <u>track is peculiar; it seems like a dhol mix</u> in the beginning but has mixed flavors as you go into it further. Well, it’s a dance floor oriented track and must listen to all party goers. Next track on the list is <b style="">“Dilruba Remix”, </b>without respecting the lyrics the song has been remixed relentlessly. The rap by Arya stand out here and “Namastey London” is also audible at places. The remix is very in vogue and is all set to make your heart beat racing. The <u>4/4 beats go very well with the hitting percussions</u> utilized to remix this song. Subsequently, <b style="">“Main Jahan Rahoon Remix” </b>comes in the list. It has been amazingly remixed by the DJ. Keeping the feelings of the song intact the song has a haunting effect when remixed but the DJ has done a formidable job. </p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;">Next is <b style="">“Yahi Hota Hai Pyar Remix”</b>, this is also a stereotype club mix. It has the building beats and all the synthetic sounds that make you wanna shake a leg. “<b style="">Aanan Faanan Remix</b>” stands consequent to the previous number, distinctly this song has fade in and fade out of the voice. The <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Congo</st1:country-region></st1:place> beats really stand out in the songs, without doubts this song can set the club on fire. Next is <b style="">“Main Jahan Rahoon Mehfil Mix” and “Yahi Hota Hai Pyar Mehfil Mix”</b> that is similar to the above Mehfil mixes. Then we have a punchy remix <b style="">“Viraaniya Remix”</b>, it seems the frustration projected in the lyrics has been transformed as the beats in the songs. The percussion really hits you hard in this song that implies it will give you the kick to dance your head off. Now with all this dancing you’ll be tired, last but not the least you have <b style="">“Rafta Rafta Remix”</b> to handle. Still <b style="">saying Rafta Rafta you put your hands up and start dancing</b> to his fast paced gripping track. Remarkably remixed, this track consists of all the elements for a hit Remix track.</p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">All in all, the album is a good deal for anyone who wants a party album, a slow musical or a regular Reshammiya compilation. The <b style="">compositions range from tragic, romantic, patriotic to dance track</b> so it well be able to satisfy a diverse range of audience. Most <u>songs are long over 5 minutes</u> that gets to your nerves at times. If you think Reshammiya has made a bad come back listen to the album else if you sense he has made a good come back this will be in you music collection for sure. </p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><u><o:p><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></o:p></u></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><u>Around 1450 Words (With title)<o:p></o:p></u></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Longest Album Review I’ve ever written as it has 18 Tracks.</p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">I haven’t provided description of the Mehfil mixes but to make it comprehensive I’ve given added information of the singers. </p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><u>Comments welcome.<o:p></o:p></u></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p></b></p></div>

With a sound system of sixty eight thousand watt capacity and dazzling lights placed in by Nepa-Sa, it was sure that the concert would go till dusk. Stated to start at 2:30 PM but the concert got underway only at around 3:30 PM. The hosts Suraj Singh Tahkuri and Mahima Bhattarai were trying to start a competition between Pakistani and Nepali makura. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Then at around 3:45 PM Steam Injuns finally appeared on the stage. Singing around 7 of their popular songs the cool band with a beautiful and talented lady did set the mood for a rocking concert. Consequently X-mantra appeared on the stage at around 4:15 PM. They also had about half a dozen of their popular tracks to offer.<span style="">  </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Finally the people were about to get what they had paid for, Strings first time Live in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It was already 5:15 PM and the sound checks and setting up the instrument and equipment just started. In quest for the impeccable sound the equipment setup ate up much of the valuable time. The crowd was getting impulsive and curious to hear their favorite Pakistani band without any delay. After all the hustle and bustle, the dynamic duo of Strings ultimately emerged on stage. The crowd roared to the talented Pakistani fiery duo. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Strings started their rocking performance at 6 PM with Chhaye Chhaye from their last album Dhaani, a great rock based track well vocalized by the vocalist, Faisal Kapadia. After it Anjane Kyon (Dekha Tujhe) from Duur charged the crowd with the amazing voice of Bilal Maqsood reacing their ears. Subsequently, the ever popular Na Jane Kyon, OST of Spiderman 2 was sung by Karachi-based band Strings with emotion provoking charisma. People in the crowd couldn’t stop waving their hands to the mesmerizing melody of the song. The crowd followed blindly what ever Kapadia asked them to do. The sight when people were waving their cell phones in air in the twilight was a sight to remember. It was amazing to witness the boys shouting their lungs out in the lyrics of Anjane Kyon.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>After it a relatively old song called Ja Raha was performed by the talented duo. The mixing of Purani Jeans in the middle by Faisal was incredible. Amazingly the crowd response was extraordinary though it had started getting dark but people didn’t stop jumping. The last song was Sar Kiyae an old song from their album Strings2 the song that made them popular initially. It was very unfortunate that the rain gods showered the untimely drizzle and the performance had to be stopped at around 6:45 PM due to technical difficulties. In just minutes the drizzle turned into a heavy downpour but the performance by Strings was an improbable experience. The crowd was not satisfied as they hoped to witness the performance of great tracks like Dhaani, Duur, Soniye, Kahani Mohobatt Ki and others. <span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Strings is a very popular band in <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region></st1:place> as well. They have been voted the most popular Pakistani band in <st1:place st="on">Asia</st1:place>, they received the award of most favorite band award in MTV Asia Awards 2005. The two-man band, comprising vocalist Faisal Kapadia and guitarist Bilal Maqsood are the national ambassadors for HIV-AIDS in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> set by UNICEF. Faisal the lead vocalist of strings was born on 29th June 1970<span style="color: rgb(90, 90, 90);font-family:Verdana;font-size:7;"  >.</span> Placing aside his family business he states “I always used music as a tool to escape the Monotony of numbers.“ He always aspired to be in a band. Similarly Bilal Maqsood the guitarist and back vocalist of strings was born on 23rd March 1971. Son of a writer he states “I never thought I&#8217;d take up music as my sole profession”. Bilal the brain of Strings owns a very soothing voice and is listed as one of the best guitarist of <st1:place st="on">Asia</st1:place>.<br /><span style="">            </span>The band was formed way back in 1989 with four guys Faisal, Bilal with two other friends including Rafiq (Who did keyboards and composing then). <span style=""> </span>The four man band released two albums Stings in 1990 and Strings 2 in 1992 but as usual the band broke up… Sar Kiyae Yeh Pahar from Strings 2 was the song to make Strings a household name. The members went to US for further study, two of them were busy in their own professional fields but the energetic duo of Faisal and Bilal wanted to tryout their creative juices. So they decided to reform the band as they completed their bachelors, but after a decade only two of them could make it out of the regular busy life. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>In 2002, the album Duur was released by the reformed two man Strings. Instantly the title track was a big hit. <st1:place st="on"><st1:state st="on">Maine</st1:state></st1:place> tujhe and Sar Kiya Yeh Pahar were two of the popular tracks then Now restricting their composition to a more slow rock pop base the band’s popularity gradually begin to rise. In 2004 they hit the market with Dhaani. Again the title track with the video did the trick. The album was very popular. When their song “Najane Kyon” got selected as an OST for the hollywood movie ‘Spiderman 2’, their fan following expanded to a worldwide form. The song though being in urdu was in sync with the movie. Almost all the songs were visualized and all of them were musical gems. Among the songs Soniye, Chhaye Chhaye and Bolo bolo feat. Hari Haran were just outstanding. Other projects they got involved in were Jeet Lo Dil with Indian band Euphoria in 2004, It was the official song for the Phillips Indo Pak Cricket Series held in <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>. In 2006, they sang two numbers for a hindi moive called Zinda. Both songs were composed by Bilal and both had been remixed by DJ and VJ Nikhil of MTV. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>With 5 albums and some amazing projects the band’s popularity has rose up in the last few years. Bagging around twenty five videos under their belt, Strings is the ultimate king of melody, rock and soothing sound mixed for a total satisfying experience. The two guys share a unique chemistry as they have been together for the last 15 years. These guys have performed almost all round the world and were trying to be in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> to perform from the last three years. Conclusively it was a short but a rocking performance by the brisk, talented and melodious Strings which was cut off by the untimely rain.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar (Around 1025 words)</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the longest things I&#8217;ve ever written.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Multitalented Denil Chitrakar was born on 26 Jestha, 2039 at Bharatpur, Chitwan. Son of a lok song singer Sunil Chitrakar, he has been arranging songs from 2056 BS and till now this has arranged around 60 songs. He has come out with his album khubi which has xx number of songs, which he claims he was able to compile in just 4 months. Basically, the album falls in the pop genre so it has not limitation in the audience aspect. Among his own songs he likes “kina  chhadyou” the most as it is a slow song and has a hum able melody. He claims that his album is distinct from others as he himself has done all the work for the album and his work is orginal. This multifaceted personality is able to compose, arrange and sing as well. He is also interested in dancing, as a kid he was very fond of Michael Jackson’s dance steps and tried imitating the king of pop. Amazingly, he can even do animation. Fact of the matter is he has himself designed the cover for his album.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Denil liked listening to Narayan Gopal as he grew up. He also admires Nepathya, Sanjay Shrestha and Karna Das in the recent times. We can say that music runs in his blood, his grandfather Mr. Nil Bahadur Chitrakar was a classical singer, his father Mr. Sunil Chitrakar used to sing folk songs at Radio <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>.

His first recorded song happens to be “Mero Sapana Bhitra” when he was in grade 10. He has ten years of working experience in Nepali music scene and he truly opposed the concept of music piracy. He believes that currently in our country a singer cannot sustain his life by just singing but also blames the pirates who pirate music for this situation. He argues that if one listener likes a song s/he should buy the original CD for the promotion of the artist and respect the creation and hardwork of the artist. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            He informs that he didn’t have to go through a struggling period as he used to arrange songs for other artists.

Compiled by DJ Santosh and marketed by Reeyaz music the album cover is very exciting but under informative about the singers and rappers specially.<span style="">  </span>It is startling that the DJ himself has been featured in the video of the first track of the album Chiya Bari Ma. He informs that it was the need of the video and acting is hard.  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>The album initiates with “Chiya Bari Ma”, sung very well by the singer and reinforced equally by the Rapper Sammy. The music is pulsating and the beat matching achieved by the DJ is impressive. Next on the track is “Chandra Surya”, energetic mix of conventional instruments and synthetic sounds with percussive techno beats is lively. But, my personal feeling is that the patriotic song could have been left untouched. After that we have the ever popular “By Road Ko Baato”, this song has a very catchy lyric to start with. The DJ has put vital effort to give it a house mix feel with 4/4 beats. With no doubts it’s simply groovy. Subsequently, we come across “Nachi Deu Maichyang”, the percussion of this song hits you hard. The singers have also poured their heart out to make this song stand our. Next is “Gharbeti Naani”, this song has a urban touch in the beginning but when the lyric is uttered it takes you back to the classics. The captivating rhythm with simple lyrics makes you listen to this song again and again. Then we have the regular 4/4 beat remix called “Maiti Ko Kausi”. It is well vocalized by the singer and I am a big fan of the song’s lyric. On the part of the remix its just the right party starter to set the dancing mood. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>At track 7 we have another controversial number “Bhenda Ko Oon Jasto”, this song has the rocking beats to make anyone jump to the dance floor. The singer can be picked up for some negligible mistakes at times but on the whole the song is pounding. Next on the list is “Jindagani”, the use of flute has made this song truly stand out. Again the blend of beats with standard instrumentation is done seamlessly by the talented DJ. In this song the singer selection could have been better. Consequently we bump into “Saal Ko Paata” it has got all the ingredients to make it a popular dance number. The hard hitting bass beats makes you go wild on the dance floor. The singer has uttered the words skillfully and the lyric is also outstanding. Rappers have also contributed their part to uplift the song. The DJ here deserves 9 out of 10 for this great remix. Next track is “Musu Musu” this is a techno blend of the two songs one in hindi from a movie and the next<span style="">  </span>our own musu musu hansi deu. The singers have completed a remarkable work. Again the beat matching by the DJ seems to be flawless. To conclude we come across “Maichhori Sundari Extended Mix”, with more focus on a power back beginning this song seems to be an instrumental in the beginning. The effort to keep the original sounds intact but still adding new foot tapping beats without polluting the song is admirable.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP8etlXWYI/AAAAAAAAABQ/k4E6p5XXv7U/s1600-h/jimmy_logo_nick.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP8etlXWYI/AAAAAAAAABQ/k4E6p5XXv7U/s320/jimmy_logo_nick.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5045153612147677570" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt;" /></a><br />My wrist watch is striking 5 after college is over. I have to wait till she gets a micro bus and then run home to catch my favorite TV show “The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron”. You might think it sounds like a cartoon, you are right it is a cartoon show. Previously aired on 5:15 pm now at 5:45 it has eased off the pressure a lot. You might ask why a guy past teen age still watches cartoon!!!  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, an American animated television series, is a spin-off of the Oscar-nominated computer-animated movie; Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, first officially aired in September 2002. This is also the first computer-animated Nicktoon. The first time I watched it, it was in the middle I just loved the graphics. The graphics was great the characters amusing and the comedy very much for the masses not only for the small children. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">The central character is Jimmy Neutron, in the town of <st1:city st="on">Retroville</st1:city>, <st1:state st="on"><st1:place st="on">Texas</st1:place></st1:state>, who gets in and out of trouble by inventing far-out gadgets. Jimmy&#8217;s main catchphrases are &#8220;Gotta Blast!&#8221;, and &#8220;Brain Blast!&#8221;, or simply the most overused phrase, &#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221;, after coming up with the ultimate idea to solve the problem. Jimmy typically has a &#8220;Brain Blast&#8221; once an episode at the climax of the story when all other ideas have failed, and it is accompanied by a visual of his ideas floating within the inner workings of his brain.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">He is ten year old genius inventor whose inventions tend to cause more destruction than help, and usually it&#8217;s up to Jimmy to save the day against his own creations. He has an extensive laboratory below his clubhouse which is accessed via hair DNA scan. Carl and Sheen are his best friends. He has a robotic dog named Goddard. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">His never ending fights with Cindy Vortex are another interesting aspect of the show. Though they love each other from inside due to peer pressure and other reasons they always fight. I just love the sequences between those two. On my recommendation many of my friends have added Jimmy to their never miss shows. We all need a way to relax; in reality it’s not possible to relax at the max so in fiction and in cartoon it’s just out of the way to let your imaginations flow. That’s why I love to watch Jimmy, it’s the no. 1 in my rankings just give it a try at 5:45 PM Tuesday-Friday on Nickelodeon channel and feel it for yourself. As far as I can I never miss it, It’s a show that will engulf you in itself for half and hour, try it to believe it.</div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"></div>Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 450 Words<br />I had even Made a website http://jimmyneutron.ifastnet.com using Drupal but couldn&#8217;t update it due to lack of time, If you people like Jimmy and want to help me you are welcome. See the website it has problems still.</div></div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">You as Mero Mobile user, may have surfed the internet via your GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) enabled mobile handsets. But have you wondered what GPRS is?</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="">  </span>GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) is a mobile data service available to users of GSM (Global System for Mobile) mobile phones. It is often described as &#8220;2.5G&#8221;, that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate speed data transfer, by using unused TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) channels in the GSM network. GPRS is a mobile data service which utilizes packet switching. It means that multiple users share the same transmission channel, only transmitting when they have data to send. This means that the total available bandwidth can be immediately dedicated to those users who are actually sending at any given moment, providing higher utilization where users only send or receive data intermittently. Web browsing, receiving e-mails as they arrive and instant messaging are examples of uses that require intermittent data transfers, which benefit from sharing the available bandwidth. Usually, GPRS data are billed per kilobytes of information transceived. Mero mobile (Spice <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>) charges Rs 0.20 for every 10 Kb traffic or Rs 750 Per month for unlimited access. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">GPRS is a connectivity solution based on Internet Protocols that supports a wide range of enterprise and consumer applications. With throughput rates of up to 40 kbit/s, users have a similar access speed to a dial-up modem, but with the convenience of being able to connect from anywhere. In addition to the IP (Internet Protocol), GPRS supports X.25, a packet-based protocol that is used mainly in Europe. GPRS is an evolutionary step toward EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Environment) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telephone Service). Almost all the new cell phone models support GPRS; some models that support GPRS are Nokia 6100, Sony Eriksson 300i, Samsung D500, LG D2100. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Environment), a faster version of the GSM wireless service, is designed to deliver data at rates up to 384 Kbps and enable the delivery of multimedia and other broadband applications to mobile phone. The EDGE standard is built on the existing GSM standard, using the same TDMA frame structure and existing cell arrangements. The Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) states that, as of April 2006, there were 139 commercial GSM/EDGE networks in 78 countries, out of a total of 192 EDGE deployments in 102 countries. The regional breakdown of commercial EDGE networks is 59 in Europe, 45 in the Americas and Caribbean, 21 in Asia, and 14 in Africa and the Middle East. GPRS is the present and EDGE may be the future, let&#8217;s hope we would also step up to EDGE some day.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;">By Geshan Manandhar </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;">About 450 Words</p>  Published on &#8220;In YOur Face&#8221; Magazine July 2007 Issue, Now NTC is also launching GPRS in near Future for Pre-Paid users and its available for Post-Paid Users.</div>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Web 2.0 or simply web2 hasn’t caught the hype in our country but is the next big thing in developed nations. In the yesteryears the concept of websites flowed like this, one information provider and many information consumers. But it is a different setting in the present circumstance, now there are many information producers/providers and many information consumers which create a many to many information sharing base. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Web 2.0 may seem like a very technical word trying to specify the version 2 of the current web infrastructure that is becoming a part of our high tech life. But it is not, Web 2.0 is a word coined by O&#8217;Reilly Media in the year 2004, that refers to the supposed second-generation of Internet-based services that let people collaborate and share information online in perceived new ways such as social networking sites, wikis, communication tools, and folksonomies. So Web 2.0 is straightforward and clear concept that advocates the websites should be a platform where all the visitors can actively participate. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">It is quite clear that Web 2.0 primarily focuses on open content and is supportive to open source. Giving emphasis on community, it is encouraging collaborative works. Hence eventually Web 2.0 tries to achieve information for the people & by the people, so as to parting the traditional Web 1.0 environment where content provider was only one and information consumers were many. In Web 2.0 the numbers of information provides and consumers will be almost same. Web 2.0 is a concept that persuades website viewers to participate and feel the belongingness to the website or the web application.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">So you might be asking what are the concrete differences in the new concept Web 2.0 and the earlier one? The answers unfold here, earlier we used to peruse through the Britannica Online encyclopedia where one who is reading if s/he finds new things on that topic is directly not able to add or alter any content but in Wikipedia it is easily possible. In any topic by collaborative effort we get great articles from wikipedia that also at no cost and no legal difficulties. Previously people used to have personal websites, now it is the era of blogging. <span style="" lang="EN">A <span style="">weblog</span>, which is usually shortened to <span style="">blog</span>, is a type of website where entries are made (such as in a journal or diary), displayed in a reverse chronological order.</span><span lang="EN"> </span>Thus, personal websites have now turned in to blogs the personal web diary of people.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Commercially, people paid for advertisement or other pages on the basis of page view but now in web 2.0 the cost is charged on the basis of cost per click. Earlier it was the concept of publishing and not letting anyone comment on it or even copy it. But now in web 2.0 the concept of participation has prevailed. In web 1.0 there used to be directories or taxonomy of the links and all other things but now it’s the age of tagging or folksonomy with a community effort. The lacking social aspect in the websites has been incredibly stressed in the new concept of web 2.0.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">As the websites based on the web 2.0 concept look forward for the participation of all the interested people so it focuses on simple design but rich features. The feature rich interface will give the even novice web users their space to participate in the website. One Nepali website that is totally based on web 2.0 and provides features like blogging, commenting on the text etc etc is <a href="http://fossnepal.org/">http://fossnepal.org</a>. If you know about Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) it is a must see for you, if you don’t know about FOSS then it is a compulsory visit for you.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Eagerly let’s hope that all the websites and webmasters will get the concept of Web 2.0 in near future. Going to Web 2.0 does not mean that you just add a guest book and it’s done. I’m not even advising that all website should follow web 2.0 as a company websites need not follow web 2.0. But if the webmasters transform their Web 1.0 websites to the new Web 2.0 it will be beneficial to both parties the developers and the website visitors. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">About 700 Words</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">This article was published on &#8220;In Your Face&#8221; Magazine Feb 06 Issue.<br /></span></p><br /><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"></p></div>

It’s a small and very handy phone with many the features. Being a Nokia product it emphasizes on user friendliness.<span style="">  </span>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Undoubtedly, it has very good sound quality. The reception of signals is also fine. The battery life is also satisfactory. The best thing about this phone is that it’s small and very well designed. Just fits in my palm and easy to operate. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Only one game is available chess puzzle when you buy it. It supports USB connection to a computer via a data cable from which you can transfer data is that given space of 256 Kb for polyphonic midi ring tones, pictures and application (games).<span style="">  </span>The organizer is also a handy tool to use; I have many day notes and remainder for jobs. Writing messages is also easy. Alarm clock, calculator comes in very useful. This GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) enabled phone give me comprehensive access to the internet on need. I am addicted to changing the wallpaper and ring tone almost daily.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">The point I am not satisfied with is that it instantly stores the numbers in phone memory. Other than that the 8 channel midi ring tone playback is also somewhat lame. Though a color mobile, but the display is not up to the mark as it is 256 color display. Playing graphic intensive games on this phone is not that satisfying. It says it has infrared but I don’t know the service point in the phone. If anyone knows please inform me. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">All in all, the phone is a must have for the person who wants a color mobile without extra features associated with a camera. If you don’t want a feature rich phone with mp3 player, FM, sound recording and video recording this is the best color mobile for you. I find more pros then cons in this model. It is really value for money, after it’s a Nokia product, which connects people. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Around 350 Words</p><p class="MsoNormal"> It was written in June 2006, so may be a not that proficient in use of language.<br /></p></div>
